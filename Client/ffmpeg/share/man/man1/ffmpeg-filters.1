.IX Title "FFMPEG-FILTERS 1"
.TH FFMPEG-FILTERS 1 " " " " " "
.SH "NAME"
ffmpeg\-filters \- FFmpeg filters
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes filters, sources, and sinks provided by the
libavfilter library.
.SH "FILTERING INTRODUCTION"
.IX Header "FILTERING INTRODUCTION"
Filtering in FFmpeg is enabled through the libavfilter library.
.PP
In libavfilter, a filter can have multiple inputs and multiple
outputs.
To illustrate the sorts of things that are possible, we consider the
following filtergraph.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&                        [main]
\&        input --> split ---------------------> overlay --> output
\&                    |                             ^
\&                    |[tmp]                  [flip]|
\&                    +-----> crop --> vflip -------+
.Ve
.PP
This filtergraph splits the input stream in two streams, then sends one
stream through the crop filter and the vflip filter, before merging it
back with the other stream by overlaying it on top. You can use the
following command to achieve this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] crop=iw:ih/2:0:0, vflip [flip]; [main][flip] overlay=0:H/2" OUTPUT
.Ve
.PP
The result will be that the top half of the video is mirrored
onto the bottom half of the output video.
.PP
Filters in the same linear chain are separated by commas, and distinct
linear chains of filters are separated by semicolons. In our example,
\&\fIcrop,vflip\fR are in one linear chain, \fIsplit\fR and
\&\fIoverlay\fR are separately in another. The points where the linear
chains join are labelled by names enclosed in square brackets. In the
example, the split filter generates two outputs that are associated to
the labels \fI[main]\fR and \fI[tmp]\fR.
.PP
The stream sent to the second output of \fIsplit\fR, labelled as
\&\fI[tmp]\fR, is processed through the \fIcrop\fR filter, which crops
away the lower half part of the video, and then vertically flipped. The
\&\fIoverlay\fR filter takes in input the first unchanged output of the
split filter (which was labelled as \fI[main]\fR), and overlay on its
lower half the output generated by the \fIcrop,vflip\fR filterchain.
.PP
Some filters take in input a list of parameters: they are specified
after the filter name and an equal sign, and are separated from each other
by a colon.
.PP
There exist so-called \fIsource filters\fR that do not have an
audio/video input, and \fIsink filters\fR that will not have audio/video
output.
.SH "GRAPH"
.IX Header "GRAPH"
The \fIgraph2dot\fR program included in the FFmpeg \fItools\fR
directory can be used to parse a filtergraph description and issue a
corresponding textual representation in the dot language.
.PP
Invoke the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        graph2dot -h
.Ve
.PP
to see how to use \fIgraph2dot\fR.
.PP
You can then pass the dot description to the \fIdot\fR program (from
the graphviz suite of programs) and obtain a graphical representation
of the filtergraph.
.PP
For example the sequence of commands:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        echo <GRAPH_DESCRIPTION> | \e
\&        tools/graph2dot -o graph.tmp && \e
\&        dot -Tpng graph.tmp -o graph.png && \e
\&        display graph.png
.Ve
.PP
can be used to create and display an image representing the graph
described by the \fI\s-1GRAPH_DESCRIPTION\s0\fR string. Note that this string must be
a complete self-contained graph, with its inputs and outputs explicitly defined.
For example if your command line is of the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i infile -vf scale=640:360 outfile
.Ve
.PP
your \fI\s-1GRAPH_DESCRIPTION\s0\fR string will need to be of the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink
.Ve
.PP
you may also need to set the \fInullsrc\fR parameters and add a \fIformat\fR
filter in order to simulate a specific input file.
.SH "FILTERGRAPH DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "FILTERGRAPH DESCRIPTION"
A filtergraph is a directed graph of connected filters. It can contain
cycles, and there can be multiple links between a pair of
filters. Each link has one input pad on one side connecting it to one
filter from which it takes its input, and one output pad on the other
side connecting it to one filter accepting its output.
.PP
Each filter in a filtergraph is an instance of a filter class
registered in the application, which defines the features and the
number of input and output pads of the filter.
.PP
A filter with no input pads is called a \*(L"source\*(R", and a filter with no
output pads is called a \*(L"sink\*(R".
.Sh "Filtergraph syntax"
.IX Subsection "Filtergraph syntax"
A filtergraph has a textual representation, which is recognized by the
\&\fB\-filter\fR/\fB\-vf\fR/\fB\-af\fR and
\&\fB\-filter_complex\fR options in \fBffmpeg\fR and
\&\fB\-vf\fR/\fB\-af\fR in \fBffplay\fR, and by the
\&\f(CW\*(C`avfilter_graph_parse_ptr()\*(C'\fR function defined in
\&\fIlibavfilter/avfilter.h\fR.
.PP
A filterchain consists of a sequence of connected filters, each one
connected to the previous one in the sequence. A filterchain is
represented by a list of \*(L",\*(R"\-separated filter descriptions.
.PP
A filtergraph consists of a sequence of filterchains. A sequence of
filterchains is represented by a list of \*(L";\*(R"\-separated filterchain
descriptions.
.PP
A filter is represented by a string of the form:
[\fIin_link_1\fR]...[\fIin_link_N\fR]\fIfilter_name\fR=\fIarguments\fR[\fIout_link_1\fR]...[\fIout_link_M\fR]
.PP
\&\fIfilter_name\fR is the name of the filter class of which the
described filter is an instance of, and has to be the name of one of
the filter classes registered in the program.
The name of the filter class is optionally followed by a string
"=\fIarguments\fR".
.PP
\&\fIarguments\fR is a string which contains the parameters used to
initialize the filter instance. It may have one of two forms:
.IP "\(bu" 4
A ':'\-separated list of \fIkey=value\fR pairs.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A ':'\-separated list of \fIvalue\fR. In this case, the keys are assumed to be
the option names in the order they are declared. E.g. the \f(CW\*(C`fade\*(C'\fR filter
declares three options in this order \*(-- \fBtype\fR, \fBstart_frame\fR and
\&\fBnb_frames\fR. Then the parameter list \fIin:0:30\fR means that the value
\&\fIin\fR is assigned to the option \fBtype\fR, \fI0\fR to
\&\fBstart_frame\fR and \fI30\fR to \fBnb_frames\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A ':'\-separated list of mixed direct \fIvalue\fR and long \fIkey=value\fR
pairs. The direct \fIvalue\fR must precede the \fIkey=value\fR pairs, and
follow the same constraints order of the previous point. The following
\&\fIkey=value\fR pairs can be set in any preferred order.
.PP
If the option value itself is a list of items (e.g. the \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR filter
takes a list of pixel formats), the items in the list are usually separated by
\&'|'.
.PP
The list of arguments can be quoted using the character \*(L"'\*(R" as initial
and ending mark, and the character '\e' for escaping the characters
within the quoted text; otherwise the argument string is considered
terminated when the next special character (belonging to the set
\&\*(L"[]=;,\*(R") is encountered.
.PP
The name and arguments of the filter are optionally preceded and
followed by a list of link labels.
A link label allows one to name a link and associate it to a filter output
or input pad. The preceding labels \fIin_link_1\fR
\&... \fIin_link_N\fR, are associated to the filter input pads,
the following labels \fIout_link_1\fR ... \fIout_link_M\fR, are
associated to the output pads.
.PP
When two link labels with the same name are found in the
filtergraph, a link between the corresponding input and output pad is
created.
.PP
If an output pad is not labelled, it is linked by default to the first
unlabelled input pad of the next filter in the filterchain.
For example in the filterchain
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        nullsrc, split[L1], [L2]overlay, nullsink
.Ve
.PP
the split filter instance has two output pads, and the overlay filter
instance two input pads. The first output pad of split is labelled
\&\*(L"L1\*(R", the first input pad of overlay is labelled \*(L"L2\*(R", and the second
output pad of split is linked to the second input pad of overlay,
which are both unlabelled.
.PP
In a filter description, if the input label of the first filter is not
specified, \*(L"in\*(R" is assumed; if the output label of the last filter is not
specified, \*(L"out\*(R" is assumed.
.PP
In a complete filterchain all the unlabelled filter input and output
pads must be connected. A filtergraph is considered valid if all the
filter input and output pads of all the filterchains are connected.
.PP
Libavfilter will automatically insert \fBscale\fR filters where format
conversion is required. It is possible to specify swscale flags
for those automatically inserted scalers by prepending
\&\f(CW\*(C`sws_flags=\f(CIflags\f(CW;\*(C'\fR
to the filtergraph description.
.PP
Here is a \s-1BNF\s0 description of the filtergraph syntax:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        <NAME>             ::= sequence of alphanumeric characters and '_'
\&        <LINKLABEL>        ::= "[" <NAME> "]"
\&        <LINKLABELS>       ::= <LINKLABEL> [<LINKLABELS>]
\&        <FILTER_ARGUMENTS> ::= sequence of chars (possibly quoted)
\&        <FILTER>           ::= [<LINKLABELS>] <NAME> ["=" <FILTER_ARGUMENTS>] [<LINKLABELS>]
\&        <FILTERCHAIN>      ::= <FILTER> [,<FILTERCHAIN>]
\&        <FILTERGRAPH>      ::= [sws_flags=<flags>;] <FILTERCHAIN> [;<FILTERGRAPH>]
.Ve
.Sh "Notes on filtergraph escaping"
.IX Subsection "Notes on filtergraph escaping"
Filtergraph description composition entails several levels of
escaping. See \fBthe \*(L"Quoting and escaping\*(R"
section in the \f(BIffmpeg\-utils\fB\|(1) manual\fR for more
information about the employed escaping procedure.
.PP
A first level escaping affects the content of each filter option
value, which may contain the special character \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR used to
separate values, or one of the escaping characters \f(CW\*(C`\e'\*(C'\fR.
.PP
A second level escaping affects the whole filter description, which
may contain the escaping characters \f(CW\*(C`\e'\*(C'\fR or the special
characters \f(CW\*(C`[],;\*(C'\fR used by the filtergraph description.
.PP
Finally, when you specify a filtergraph on a shell commandline, you
need to perform a third level escaping for the shell special
characters contained within it.
.PP
For example, consider the following string to be embedded in
the \fBdrawtext\fR filter description \fBtext\fR value:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        this is a 'string': may contain one, or more, special characters
.Ve
.PP
This string contains the \f(CW\*(C`'\*(C'\fR special escaping character, and the
\&\f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR special character, so it needs to be escaped in this way:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        text=this is a \e'string\e'\e: may contain one, or more, special characters
.Ve
.PP
A second level of escaping is required when embedding the filter
description in a filtergraph description, in order to escape all the
filtergraph special characters. Thus the example above becomes:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        drawtext=text=this is a \e\e\e'string\e\e\e'\e\e: may contain one\e, or more\e, special characters
.Ve
.PP
(note that in addition to the \f(CW\*(C`\e'\*(C'\fR escaping special characters,
also \f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR needs to be escaped).
.PP
Finally an additional level of escaping is needed when writing the
filtergraph description in a shell command, which depends on the
escaping rules of the adopted shell. For example, assuming that
\&\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR is special and needs to be escaped with another \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR, the
previous string will finally result in:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        -vf "drawtext=text=this is a \e\e\e\e\e\e'string\e\e\e\e\e\e'\e\e\e\e: may contain one\e\e, or more\e\e, special characters"
.Ve
.SH "TIMELINE EDITING"
.IX Header "TIMELINE EDITING"
Some filters support a generic \fBenable\fR option. For the filters
supporting timeline editing, this option can be set to an expression which is
evaluated before sending a frame to the filter. If the evaluation is non\-zero,
the filter will be enabled, otherwise the frame will be sent unchanged to the
next filter in the filtergraph.
.PP
The expression accepts the following values:
.IP "\fBt\fR" 4
.IX Item "t"
timestamp expressed in seconds, \s-1NAN\s0 if the input timestamp is unknown
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0
.IP "\fBpos\fR" 4
.IX Item "pos"
the position in the file of the input frame, \s-1NAN\s0 if unknown
.IP "\fBw\fR" 4
.IX Item "w"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBh\fR" 4
.IX Item "h"
.PD
width and height of the input frame if video
.PP
Additionally, these filters support an \fBenable\fR command that can be used
to re-define the expression.
.PP
Like any other filtering option, the \fBenable\fR option follows the same
rules.
.PP
For example, to enable a blur filter (\fBsmartblur\fR) from 10 seconds to 3
minutes, and a \fBcurves\fR filter starting at 3 seconds:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        smartblur = enable='between(t,10,3*60)',
\&        curves    = enable='gte(t,3)' : preset=cross_process
.Ve
.SH "AUDIO FILTERS"
.IX Header "AUDIO FILTERS"
When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
existing filters using \f(CW\*(C`\-\-disable\-filters\*(C'\fR.
The configure output will show the audio filters included in your
build.
.PP
Below is a description of the currently available audio filters.
.Sh "adelay"
.IX Subsection "adelay"
Delay one or more audio channels.
.PP
Samples in delayed channel are filled with silence.
.PP
The filter accepts the following option:
.IP "\fBdelays\fR" 4
.IX Item "delays"
Set list of delays in milliseconds for each channel separated by '|'.
At least one delay greater than 0 should be provided.
Unused delays will be silently ignored. If number of given delays is
smaller than number of channels all remaining channels will not be delayed.
.PP
\fIExamples\fR
.IX Subsection "Examples"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Delay first channel by 1.5 seconds, the third channel by 0.5 seconds and leave
the second channel (and any other channels that may be present) unchanged.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        adelay=1500|0|500
.Ve
.Sh "aecho"
.IX Subsection "aecho"
Apply echoing to the input audio.
.PP
Echoes are reflected sound and can occur naturally amongst mountains
(and sometimes large buildings) when talking or shouting; digital echo
effects emulate this behaviour and are often used to help fill out the
sound of a single instrument or vocal. The time difference between the
original signal and the reflection is the \f(CW\*(C`delay\*(C'\fR, and the
loudness of the reflected signal is the \f(CW\*(C`decay\*(C'\fR.
Multiple echoes can have different delays and decays.
.PP
A description of the accepted parameters follows.
.IP "\fBin_gain\fR" 4
.IX Item "in_gain"
Set input gain of reflected signal. Default is \f(CW0.6\fR.
.IP "\fBout_gain\fR" 4
.IX Item "out_gain"
Set output gain of reflected signal. Default is \f(CW0.3\fR.
.IP "\fBdelays\fR" 4
.IX Item "delays"
Set list of time intervals in milliseconds between original signal and reflections
separated by '|'. Allowed range for each \f(CW\*(C`delay\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`(0 \- 90000.0]\*(C'\fR.
Default is \f(CW1000\fR.
.IP "\fBdecays\fR" 4
.IX Item "decays"
Set list of loudnesses of reflected signals separated by '|'.
Allowed range for each \f(CW\*(C`decay\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`(0 \- 1.0]\*(C'\fR.
Default is \f(CW0.5\fR.
.PP
\fIExamples\fR
.IX Subsection "Examples"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Make it sound as if there are twice as many instruments as are actually playing:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        aecho=0.8:0.88:60:0.4
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
If delay is very short, then it sound like a (metallic) robot playing music:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        aecho=0.8:0.88:6:0.4
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
A longer delay will sound like an open air concert in the mountains:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        aecho=0.8:0.9:1000:0.3
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Same as above but with one more mountain:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        aecho=0.8:0.9:1000|1800:0.3|0.25
.Ve
.Sh "aeval"
.IX Subsection "aeval"
Modify an audio signal according to the specified expressions.
.PP
This filter accepts one or more expressions (one for each channel),
which are evaluated and used to modify a corresponding audio signal.
.PP
It accepts the following parameters:
.IP "\fBexprs\fR" 4
.IX Item "exprs"
Set the '|'\-separated expressions list for each separate channel. If
the number of input channels is greater than the number of
expressions, the last specified expression is used for the remaining
output channels.
.IP "\fBchannel_layout, c\fR" 4
.IX Item "channel_layout, c"
Set output channel layout. If not specified, the channel layout is
specified by the number of expressions. If set to \fBsame\fR, it will
use by default the same input channel layout.
.PP
Each expression in \fIexprs\fR can contain the following constants and functions:
.IP "\fBch\fR" 4
.IX Item "ch"
channel number of the current expression
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
number of the evaluated sample, starting from 0
.IP "\fBs\fR" 4
.IX Item "s"
sample rate
.IP "\fBt\fR" 4
.IX Item "t"
time of the evaluated sample expressed in seconds
.IP "\fBnb_in_channels\fR" 4
.IX Item "nb_in_channels"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBnb_out_channels\fR" 4
.IX Item "nb_out_channels"

input and output number of channels
.IP "\fBval(\s-1CH\s0)\fR" 4
.IX Item "val(CH)"

The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBinputs\fR" 4
.IX Item "inputs"
Set the number of inputs. Default is 2.
.PP
If the channel layouts of the inputs are disjoint, and therefore compatible,
the channel layout of the output will be set accordingly and the channels
will be reordered as necessary. If the channel layouts of the inputs are not
disjoint, the output will have all the channels of the first input then all
the channels of the second input, in that order, and the channel layout of
the output will be the default value corresponding to the total number of
channels.
.PP
For example, if the first input is in 2.1 (\s-1FL+FR+LF\s0) and the second input
is \s-1FC+BL+BR\s0, then the output will be in 5.1, with the channels in the
following order: a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel of the
first input, b1 is the first channel of the second input).
.PP
On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output channels will be
in the default order: a1, a2, b1, b2, and the channel layout will be
arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may or may not be the expected value.

.IP "\fBmin_delta\fR" 4

.IP "\fBfirst_pts\fR" 4
.IX Item "first_pts"
Assume that the first \s-1PTS\s0 should be this value. The time base is 1 / sample
rate. This allows for padding/trimming at the start of the stream. By default,
no assumption is made about the first frame's expected \s-1PTS\s0, so no padding or
trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with
silence if an audio stream starts after the video stream or to trim any samples

\&\fBstart\fR, \fBend\fR, and \fBduration\fR are expressed as time
duration specifications; see
\&\fBthe Time duration section in the \f(BIffmpeg\-utils\fB\|(1) manual\fR.
.PP
Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the \fBduration\fR
option look at the frame timestamp, while the _sample options simply count the
samples that pass through the filter. So start/end_pts and start/end_sample will
give different results when the timestamps are wrong, inexact or do not start at
zero. Also note that this filter does not modify the timestamps. If you wish
to have the output timestamps start at zero, insert the asetpts filter after the
atrim filter.
.PP
If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all samples that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple atrim
filters.
.PP
The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.

.PD 0
.IP "\fBdecays\fR" 4
.IX Item "decays"
.PD
A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level
of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume. \fIattacks\fR refers to
increase of volume and \fIdecays\fR refers to decrease of volume. For most
situations, the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be
shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden
loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and
a typical value for decay is 0.8 seconds.
.IP "\fBpoints\fR" 4
.IX Item "points"
A list of points for the transfer function, specified in dB relative to the
maximum possible signal amplitude. Each key points list must be defined using
the following syntax: \f(CW\*(C`x0/y0|x1/y1|x2/y2|....\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ....\*(C'\fR
.Sp
The input values must be in strictly increasing order but the transfer function
does not have to be monotonically rising. The point \f(CW\*(C`0/0\*(C'\fR is assumed but
may be overridden (by \f(CW\*(C`0/out\-dBn\*(C'\fR). Typical values for the transfer
function are \f(CW\*(C`\-70/\-70|\-60/\-20\*(C'\fR.

Set the additional gain in dB to be applied at all points on the transfer
function. This allows for easy adjustment of the overall gain.
It defaults to 0.
.IP "\fBvolume\fR" 4
.IX Item "volume"
Set an initial volume, in dB, to be assumed for each channel when filtering
starts. This permits the user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for
example, a very large gain is not applied to initial signal levels before the
companding has begun to operate. A typical value for audio which is initially
quiet is \-90 dB. It defaults to 0.
.IP "\fBdelay\fR" 4
.IX Item "delay"
Set a delay, in seconds. The input audio is analyzed immediately, but audio is
delayed before being fed to the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay
approximately equal to the attack/decay times allows the filter to effectively
operate in predictive rather than reactive mode. It defaults to 0.

.Sh "silenceremove"
.IX Subsection "silenceremove"
Remove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the audio.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBstart_periods\fR" 4
.IX Item "start_periods"
This value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of
the audio. A value of zero indicates no silence should be trimmed from the
beginning. When specifying a non-zero value, it trims audio up until it
finds non\-silence. Normally, when trimming silence from beginning of audio
the \fIstart_periods\fR will be \f(CW1\fR but it can be increased to higher
values to trim all audio up to specific count of non-silence periods.
Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBstart_duration\fR" 4
.IX Item "start_duration"
Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops
trimming audio. By increasing the duration, bursts of noises can be treated
as silence and trimmed off. Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBstart_threshold\fR" 4
.IX Item "start_threshold"
This indicates what sample value should be treated as silence. For digital
audio, a value of \f(CW0\fR may be fine but for audio recorded from analog,
you may wish to increase the value to account for background noise.
Can be specified in dB (in case \*(L"dB\*(R" is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBstop_periods\fR" 4
.IX Item "stop_periods"
Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio.
To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a \fIstop_periods\fR
that is negative. This value is then treated as a positive value and is
used to indicate the effect should restart processing as specified by
\&\fIstart_periods\fR, making it suitable for removing periods of silence
in the middle of the audio.
Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBstop_duration\fR" 4
.IX Item "stop_duration"
Specify a duration of silence that must exist before audio is not copied any
more. By specifying a higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in
the audio.
Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBstop_threshold\fR" 4
.IX Item "stop_threshold"
This is the same as \fBstart_threshold\fR but for trimming silence from
the end of audio.
Can be specified in dB (in case \*(L"dB\*(R" is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBleave_silence\fR" 4
.IX Item "leave_silence"
This indicate that \fIstop_duration\fR length of audio should be left intact
at the beginning of each period of silence.
For example, if you want to remove long pauses between words but do not want
to remove the pauses completely. Default value is \f(CW0\fR.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the

.PP
Below is a description of the currently available video filters.
.Sh "alphaextract"
.IX Subsection "alphaextract"
Extract the alpha component from the input as a grayscale video. This
is especially useful with the \fIalphamerge\fR filter.
.Sh "alphamerge"
.IX Subsection "alphamerge"
Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the
grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for use with
\&\fIalphaextract\fR to allow the transmission or storage of frame
sequences that have alpha in a format that doesn't support an alpha
channel.
.PP
For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal YUV-encoded video
and a separate video created with \fIalphaextract\fR, you might use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        movie=in_alpha.mkv [alpha]; [in][alpha] alphamerge [out]
.Ve
.PP
Since this filter is designed for reconstruction, it operates on frame
sequences without considering timestamps, and terminates when either
input reaches end of stream. This will cause problems if your encoding
pipeline drops frames. If you're trying to apply an image as an
overlay to a video stream, consider the \fIoverlay\fR filter instead.

.IX Subsection "cropdetect"
Auto-detect the crop size.
.PP
It calculates the necessary cropping parameters and prints the
recommended parameters via the logging system. The detected dimensions
correspond to the non-black area of the input video.
.PP
It accepts the following parameters:
.IP "\fBlimit\fR" 4
.IX Item "limit"
Set higher black value threshold, which can be optionally specified
from nothing (0) to everything (255 for 8bit based formats). An intensity
value greater to the set value is considered non\-black. It defaults to 24.
You can also specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which will be scaled depending
on the bitdepth of the pixel format.
.IP "\fBround\fR" 4
.IX Item "round"
The value which the width/height should be divisible by. It defaults to
16. The offset is automatically adjusted to center the video. Use 2 to
get only even dimensions (needed for 4:2:2 video). 16 is best when
encoding to most video codecs.
.IP "\fBreset_count, reset\fR" 4
.IX Item "reset_count, reset"
Set the counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will
reset the previously detected largest video area and start over to
detect the current optimal crop area. Default value is 0.
.Sp
This can be useful when channel logos distort the video area. 0
indicates 'never reset', and returns the largest area encountered during
playback.
.Sh "curves"
.IX Subsection "curves"
Apply color adjustments using curves.
.PP
This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop and \s-1GIMP\s0 curves tools. Each
component (red, green and blue) has its values defined by \fIN\fR key points
tied from each other using a smooth curve. The x\-axis represents the pixel
values from the input frame, and the y\-axis the new pixel values to be set for
the output frame.
.PP
By default, a component curve is defined by the two points \fI(0;0)\fR and
\&\fI(1;1)\fR. This creates a straight line where each original pixel value is
\&\*(L"adjusted\*(R" to its own value, which means no change to the image.
.PP
The filter allows you to redefine these two points and add some more. A new
curve (using a natural cubic spline interpolation) will be define to pass
smoothly through all these new coordinates. The new defined points needs to be
strictly increasing over the x\-axis, and their \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR values must
be in the \fI[0;1]\fR interval.  If the computed curves happened to go outside
the vector spaces, the values will be clipped accordingly.
.PP
If there is no key point defined in \f(CW\*(C`x=0\*(C'\fR, the filter will automatically
insert a \fI(0;0)\fR point. In the same way, if there is no key point defined
in \f(CW\*(C`x=1\*(C'\fR, the filter will automatically insert a \fI(1;1)\fR point.
.PP

may want to reduce this value, at the cost of a less effective filter and the
risk of various artefacts.
.Sp
If the overlapping value doesn't allow to process the whole input width or

Default value is \fIblocksize\fR\-1, which is the best possible setting.
.IP "\fBexpr, e\fR" 4
.IX Item "expr, e"
Set the coefficient factor expression.
.Sp
For each coefficient of a \s-1DCT\s0 block, this expression will be evaluated as a
multiplier value for the coefficient.

\fIText expansion\fR
.IX Subsection "Text expansion"
.PP
If \fBexpansion\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR,
the filter recognizes \fIstrftime()\fR sequences in the provided text and
expands them accordingly. Check the documentation of \fIstrftime()\fR. This
feature is deprecated.
.PP
If \fBexpansion\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, the text is printed verbatim.
.PP
If \fBexpansion\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`normal\*(C'\fR (which is the default),
the following expansion mechanism is used.
.PP
The backslash character '\e', followed by any character, always expands to
the second character.
.PP
Sequence of the form \f(CW\*(C`%{...}\*(C'\fR are expanded. The text between the
braces is a function name, possibly followed by arguments separated by ':'.
If the arguments contain special characters or delimiters (':' or '}'),
they should be escaped.
.PP
Note that they probably must also be escaped as the value for the
\&\fBtext\fR option in the filter argument string and as the filter
argument in the filtergraph description, and possibly also for the shell,
that makes up to four levels of escaping; using a text file avoids these
problems.
.PP
The following functions are available:
.IP "\fBexpr, e\fR" 4
.IX Item "expr, e"
The expression evaluation result.
.Sp
It must take one argument specifying the expression to be evaluated,
which accepts the same constants and functions as the \fIx\fR and
\&\fIy\fR values. Note that not all constants should be used, for
example the text size is not known when evaluating the expression, so
the constants \fItext_w\fR and \fItext_h\fR will have an undefined
value.
.IP "\fBexpr_int_format, eif\fR" 4
.IX Item "expr_int_format, eif"
Evaluate the expression's value and output as formatted integer.
.Sp
The first argument is the expression to be evaluated, just as for the \fIexpr\fR function.
The second argument specifies the output format. Allowed values are 'x', 'X', 'd' and
\&'u'. They are treated exactly as in the printf function.
The third parameter is optional and sets the number of positions taken by the output.
It can be used to add padding with zeros from the left.
.IP "\fBgmtime\fR" 4

.Sh "fieldmatch"
.IX Subsection "fieldmatch"
Field matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the
progressive frames from a telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated
frames, so to achieve a complete inverse telecine \f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR needs to be
followed by a decimation filter such as \fBdecimate\fR in the filtergraph.
.PP
The separation of the field matching and the decimation is notably motivated by
the possibility of inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two.
If the source has mixed telecined and real interlaced content,
\&\f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts.
But these remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be
de-interlaced by a later filter such as \fByadif\fR before decimation.
.PP
In addition to the various configuration options, \f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR can take an
optional second stream, activated through the \fBppsrc\fR option. If
enabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from
this second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed in order to
help the various algorithms of the filter, while keeping the output lossless
(assuming the fields are matched properly). Typically, a field-aware denoiser,
or brightness/contrast adjustments can help.
.PP
Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as \s-1TIVTC/TFM\s0 (AviSynth project)
and \s-1VIVTC/VFM\s0 (VapourSynth project). The later is a light clone of \s-1TFM\s0 from
which \f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR is based on. While the semantic and usage are very
close, some behaviour and options names can differ.
.PP
The \fBdecimate\fR filter currently only works for constant frame rate input.
Do not use \f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR and \fBdecimate\fR if your input has mixed
telecined and progressive content with changing framerate.

outputting combed frames when a good match might actually exist. On the other
hand, \fBpcn_ub\fR mode is the most risky in terms of creating jerkiness,
but will almost always find a good frame if there is one. The other values are
all somewhere in between \fBpc\fR and \fBpcn_ub\fR in terms of risking
jerkiness and creating duplicate frames versus finding good matches in sections
with bad edits, orphaned fields, blended fields, etc.

.Sh "fieldorder"
.IX Subsection "fieldorder"
Transform the field order of the input video.
.PP
It accepts the following parameters:
.IP "\fBorder\fR" 4
.IX Item "order"
The output field order. Valid values are \fItff\fR for top field first or \fIbff\fR
for bottom field first.
.PP
The default value is \fBtff\fR.
.PP
The transformation is done by shifting the picture content up or down
by one line, and filling the remaining line with appropriate picture content.
This method is consistent with most broadcast field order converters.
.PP
If the input video is not flagged as being interlaced, or it is already
flagged as being of the required output field order, then this filter does
not alter the incoming video.

Assume the first \s-1PTS\s0 should be the given value, in seconds. This allows for
padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no assumption is made
about the first frame's expected \s-1PTS\s0, so no padding or trimming is done.
For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with duplicates of
the first frame if a video stream starts after the audio stream or to trim any
frames with a negative \s-1PTS\s0.

.IX Subsection "histeq"
This filter applies a global color histogram equalization on a
per-frame basis.
.PP
It can be used to correct video that has a compressed range of pixel
intensities.  The filter redistributes the pixel intensities to
equalize their distribution across the intensity range. It may be
viewed as an \*(L"automatically adjusting contrast filter\*(R". This filter is
useful only for correcting degraded or poorly captured source
video.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBstrength\fR" 4
.IX Item "strength"
Determine the amount of equalization to be applied.  As the strength
is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more-and-more
approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number
in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.
.IP "\fBintensity\fR" 4
.IX Item "intensity"
Set the maximum intensity that can generated and scale the output
values appropriately.  The strength should be set as desired and then
the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid washing\-out. The value
must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.
.IP "\fBantibanding\fR" 4
.IX Item "antibanding"
Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter will randomly vary

.IX Item "mode"
Set histogram mode.
.Sp
It accepts the following values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBlevels\fR" 4
.IX Item "levels"
Standard histogram that displays the color components distribution in an
image. Displays color graph for each color component. Shows distribution of
the Y, U, V, A or R, G, B components, depending on input format, in the
current frame. Below each graph a color component scale meter is shown.
.IP "\fBcolor\fR" 4
.IX Item "color"
Displays chroma values (U/V color placement) in a two dimensional
graph (which is called a vectorscope). The brighter a pixel in the
vectorscope, the more pixels of the input frame correspond to that pixel
(i.e., more pixels have this chroma value). The V component is displayed on
the horizontal (X) axis, with the leftmost side being V = 0 and the rightmost
side being V = 255. The U component is displayed on the vertical (Y) axis,
with the top representing U = 0 and the bottom representing U = 255.
.Sp
The position of a white pixel in the graph corresponds to the chroma value of
a pixel of the input clip. The graph can therefore be used to read the hue
(color flavor) and the saturation (the dominance of the hue in the color). As
the hue of a color changes, it moves around the square. At the center of the
square the saturation is zero, which means that the corresponding pixel has no
color. If the amount of a specific color is increased (while leaving the other
colors unchanged) the saturation increases, and the indicator moves towards
the edge of the square.
.IP "\fBcolor2\fR" 4
.IX Item "color2"
Chroma values in vectorscope, similar as \f(CW\*(C`color\*(C'\fR but actual chroma values
are displayed.
.IP "\fBwaveform\fR" 4

Per row/column color component graph. In row mode, the graph on the left side
represents color component value 0 and the right side represents value = 255.

.IP "\fBwaveform_mirror\fR" 4
.IX Item "waveform_mirror"
Set mirroring mode for \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR. \f(CW0\fR means unmirrored, \f(CW1\fR
means mirrored. In mirrored mode, higher values will be represented on the left
side for \f(CW\*(C`row\*(C'\fR mode and at the top for \f(CW\*(C`column\*(C'\fR mode. Default is
\&\f(CW0\fR (unmirrored).
.IP "\fBdisplay_mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "display_mode"
Set display mode for \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`levels\*(C'\fR.
It accepts the following values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBparade\fR" 4
.IX Item "parade"
Display separate graph for the color components side by side in
\&\f(CW\*(C`row\*(C'\fR waveform mode or one below the other in \f(CW\*(C`column\*(C'\fR waveform mode
for \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR histogram mode. For \f(CW\*(C`levels\*(C'\fR histogram mode,
per color component graphs are placed below each other.
.Sp
Using this display mode in \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR histogram mode makes it easy to
spot color casts in the highlights and shadows of an image, by comparing the
contours of the top and the bottom graphs of each waveform. Since whites,
grays, and blacks are characterized by exactly equal amounts of red, green,
and blue, neutral areas of the picture should display three waveforms of
roughly equal width/height. If not, the correction is easy to perform by
making level adjustments the three waveforms.
.IP "\fBoverlay\fR" 4
.IX Item "overlay"
Presents information identical to that in the \f(CW\*(C`parade\*(C'\fR, except
that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly
over one another.
.Sp
This display mode in \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR histogram mode makes it easier to spot
relative differences or similarities in overlapping areas of the color
components that are supposed to be identical, such as neutral whites, grays,
or blacks.

Correct radial lens distortion
.PP
This filter can be used to correct for radial distortion as can result from the use
of wide angle lenses, and thereby re-rectify the image. To find the right parameters
one can use tools available for example as part of opencv or simply trial\-and\-error.
To use opencv use the calibration sample (under samples/cpp) from the opencv sources
and extract the k1 and k2 coefficients from the resulting matrix.
.PP
Note that effectively the same filter is available in the open-source tools Krita and
Digikam from the \s-1KDE\s0 project.
.PP
In contrast to the \fBvignette\fR filter, which can also be used to compensate lens errors,
this filter corrects the distortion of the image, whereas \fBvignette\fR corrects the
brightness distribution, so you may want to use both filters together in certain
cases, though you will have to take care of ordering, i.e. whether vignetting should
be applied before or after lens correction.

Values for \fBhi\fR and \fBlo\fR are for 8x8 pixel blocks and
represent actual pixel value differences, so a threshold of 64
corresponds to 1 unit of difference for each pixel, or the same spread
out differently over the block.

A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 blocks differ by more
than a threshold of \fBhi\fR, and if no more than \fBfrac\fR blocks (1
meaning the whole image) differ by more than a threshold of \fBlo\fR.

.PP
Dilate an image by using a specific structuring element.
It corresponds to the libopencv function \f(CW\*(C`cvDilate\*(C'\fR.
.PP
It accepts the parameters: \fIstruct_el\fR|\fInb_iterations\fR.
.PP
\&\fIstruct_el\fR represents a structuring element, and has the syntax:
\&\fIcols\fRx\fIrows\fR+\fIanchor_x\fRx\fIanchor_y\fR/\fIshape\fR
.PP
\&\fIcols\fR and \fIrows\fR represent the number of columns and rows of
the structuring element, \fIanchor_x\fR and \fIanchor_y\fR the anchor
point, and \fIshape\fR the shape for the structuring element. \fIshape\fR
must be \*(L"rect\*(R", \*(L"cross\*(R", \*(L"ellipse\*(R", or \*(L"custom\*(R".
.PP
If the value for \fIshape\fR is \*(L"custom\*(R", it must be followed by a
string of the form "=\fIfilename\fR". The file with name
\&\fIfilename\fR is assumed to represent a binary image, with each
printable character corresponding to a bright pixel. When a custom
\&\fIshape\fR is used, \fIcols\fR and \fIrows\fR are ignored, the number
or columns and rows of the read file are assumed instead.
.PP
The default value for \fIstruct_el\fR is \*(L"3x3+0x0/rect\*(R".
.PP
\&\fInb_iterations\fR specifies the number of times the transform is
applied to the image, and defaults to 1.

with the same syntax and semantics as the \fBdilate\fR filter.
.PP
\fIsmooth\fR
.IX Subsection "smooth"
.PP
Smooth the input video.
.PP
The filter takes the following parameters:
\&\fItype\fR|\fIparam1\fR|\fIparam2\fR|\fIparam3\fR|\fIparam4\fR.
.PP
\&\fItype\fR is the type of smooth filter to apply, and must be one of
the following values: \*(L"blur\*(R", \*(L"blur_no_scale\*(R", \*(L"median\*(R", \*(L"gaussian\*(R",
or \*(L"bilateral\*(R". The default value is \*(L"gaussian\*(R".
.PP
The meaning of \fIparam1\fR, \fIparam2\fR, \fIparam3\fR, and \fIparam4\fR
depend on the smooth type. \fIparam1\fR and
\&\fIparam2\fR accept integer positive values or 0. \fIparam3\fR and
\&\fIparam4\fR accept floating point values.
.PP
The default value for \fIparam1\fR is 3. The default value for the
other parameters is 0.

.IP "\fBpos\fR" 4
.IX Item "pos"
the position in the file of the input frame, \s-1NAN\s0 if unknown
.IP "\fBt\fR" 4
.IX Item "t"

.PP
Note that the \fIn\fR, \fIpos\fR, \fIt\fR variables are available only
when evaluation is done \fIper frame\fR, and will evaluate to \s-1NAN\s0
when \fBeval\fR is set to \fBinit\fR.
.PP
Be aware that frames are taken from each input video in timestamp
order, hence, if their initial timestamps differ, it is a good idea
to pass the two inputs through a \fIsetpts=PTS\-STARTPTS\fR filter to
have them begin in the same zero timestamp, as the example for
the \fImovie\fR filter does.

onto a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following
fields in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.
.PP
To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps filter after
pullup, use \f(CW\*(C`fps=24000/1001\*(C'\fR if the input frame rate is 29.97fps,

while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines.
The default is 8 pixels on each side.

Set the strict breaks. Setting this option to 1 will reduce the chances of
filter generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also cause an
excessive number of frames to be dropped during high motion sequences.
Conversely, setting it to \-1 will make filter match fields more easily.
This may help processing of video where there is slight blurring between
the fields, but may also cause there to be interlaced frames in the output.

This option may be set to use chroma plane instead of the default luma plane
for doing filter's computations. This may improve accuracy on very clean
source material, but more likely will decrease accuracy, especially if there
is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any grayscale video.
The main purpose of setting \fBmp\fR to a chroma plane is to reduce \s-1CPU\s0
load and make pullup usable in realtime on slow machines.

Suppress a \s-1TV\s0 station logo, using an image file to determine which
pixels comprise the logo. It works by filling in the pixels that
comprise the logo with neighboring pixels.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBfilename, f\fR" 4
.IX Item "filename, f"
Set the filter bitmap file, which can be any image format supported by
libavformat. The width and height of the image file must match those of the
video stream being processed.
.PP
Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not
considered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of
the logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the
rest, you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is
recommended to take a screen capture of a black frame with the logo
visible, and then using a threshold filter followed by the erode
filter once or twice.
.PP
If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if
logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much
reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as
much, but it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over
the image and will destroy more information than necessary, and extra
pixels will slow things down on a large logo.

One useful instance of this option is that when you know a specific device's
maximum allowed resolution, you can use this to limit the output video to
that, while retaining the aspect ratio. For example, device A allows

decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the output
1280x533.

\&\fBstart\fR, \fBend\fR, and \fBduration\fR are expressed as time
duration specifications; see
\&\fBthe Time duration section in the \f(BIffmpeg\-utils\fB\|(1) manual\fR
for the accepted syntax.
.PP
Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the \fBduration\fR
option look at the frame timestamp, while the _frame variants simply count the
frames that pass through the filter. Also note that this filter does not modify
the timestamps. If you wish for the output timestamps to start at zero, insert a
setpts filter after the trim filter.
.PP
If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all the frames that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple trim
filters.
.PP
The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.

Apply ultra slow/simple postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses
the image at several (or \- in the case of \fBquality\fR level \f(CW8\fR \- all)
shifts and average the results.
.PP
The way this differs from the behavior of spp is that uspp actually encodes &
decodes each case with libavcodec Snow, whereas spp uses a simplified intra only 8x8
\&\s-1DCT\s0 similar to \s-1MJPEG\s0.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBquality\fR" 4
.IX Item "quality"
Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts
an integer in the range 0\-8. If set to \f(CW0\fR, the filter will have no
effect. A value of \f(CW8\fR means the higher quality. For each increment of
that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2.  Default value is
\&\f(CW3\fR.
.IP "\fBqp\fR" 4
.IX Item "qp"
Force a constant quantization parameter. If not set, the filter will use the \s-1QP\s0

.IX Subsection "vidstabdetect"
Analyze video stabilization/deshaking. Perform pass 1 of 2, see
\&\fBvidstabtransform\fR for pass 2.
.PP
This filter generates a file with relative translation and rotation
transform information about subsequent frames, which is then used by
the \fBvidstabtransform\fR filter.

Set how shaky the video is and how quick the camera is. It accepts an
integer in the range 1\-10, a value of 1 means little shakiness, a
value of 10 means strong shakiness. Default value is 5.
.IP "\fBaccuracy\fR" 4
.IX Item "accuracy"
Set the accuracy of the detection process. It must be a value in the
range 1\-15. A value of 1 means low accuracy, a value of 15 means high
accuracy. Default value is 15.
.IP "\fBstepsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "stepsize"
Set stepsize of the search process. The region around minimum is
scanned with 1 pixel resolution. Default value is 6.
.IP "\fBmincontrast\fR" 4

will instruct the source to accept video frames with size 320x240 and
with format \*(L"yuv410p\*(R", assuming 1/24 as the timestamps timebase and
square pixels (1:1 sample aspect ratio).
Since the pixel format with name \*(L"yuv410p\*(R" corresponds to the number 6

.Sh "life"
.IX Subsection "life"
Generate a life pattern.
.PP
This source is based on a generalization of John Conway's life game.
.PP
The sourced input represents a life grid, each pixel represents a cell
which can be in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell
interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
.PP
At each interaction the grid evolves according to the adopted rule,
which specifies the number of neighbor alive cells which will make a
cell stay alive or born. The \fBrule\fR option allows one to specify
the rule to adopt.
.PP
This source accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBfilename, f\fR" 4
.IX Item "filename, f"
Set the file from which to read the initial grid state. In the file,
each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, and newline
is used to delimit the end of each row.
.Sp
If this option is not specified, the initial grid is generated
randomly.
.IP "\fBrate, r\fR" 4
.IX Item "rate, r"
Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second.
Default is 25.
.IP "\fBrandom_fill_ratio, ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "random_fill_ratio, ratio"
Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a
floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.
It is ignored when a file is specified.
.IP "\fBrandom_seed, seed\fR" 4
.IX Item "random_seed, seed"
Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be an integer
included between 0 and \s-1UINT32_MAX\s0. If not specified, or if explicitly
set to \-1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
effort basis.
.IP "\fBrule\fR" 4
.IX Item "rule"
Set the life rule.
.Sp
A rule can be specified with a code of the kind "S\fI\s-1NS\s0\fR/B\fI\s-1NB\s0\fR",
where \fI\s-1NS\s0\fR and \fI\s-1NB\s0\fR are sequences of numbers in the range 0\-8,
\&\fI\s-1NS\s0\fR specifies the number of alive neighbor cells which make a
live cell stay alive, and \fI\s-1NB\s0\fR the number of alive neighbor cells
which make a dead cell to become alive (i.e. to \*(L"born\*(R").
\&\*(L"s\*(R" and \*(L"b\*(R" can be used in place of \*(L"S\*(R" and \*(L"B\*(R", respectively.
.Sp
Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18\-bits integer. The 9
high order bits are used to encode the next cell state if it is alive
for each number of neighbor alive cells, the low order bits specify
the rule for \*(L"borning\*(R" new cells. Higher order bits encode for an
higher number of neighbor cells.
For example the number 6153 = \f(CW\*(C`(12<<9)+9\*(C'\fR specifies a stay alive
rule of 12 and a born rule of 9, which corresponds to \*(L"S23/B03\*(R".
.Sp
Default value is \*(L"S23/B3\*(R", which is the original Conway's game of life
rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor alive
cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive cells around
a dead cell.
.IP "\fBsize, s\fR" 4
.IX Item "size, s"
Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the
\&\*(L"Video size\*(R" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.
.Sp
If \fBfilename\fR is specified, the size is set by default to the
same size of the input file. If \fBsize\fR is set, it must contain
the size specified in the input file, and the initial grid defined in
that file is centered in the larger resulting area.
.Sp
If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults to \*(L"320x240\*(R"
(used for a randomly generated initial grid).
.IP "\fBstitch\fR" 4
.IX Item "stitch"
If set to 1, stitch the left and right grid edges together, and the
top and bottom edges also. Defaults to 1.
.IP "\fBmold\fR" 4
.IX Item "mold"
Set cell mold speed. If set, a dead cell will go from \fBdeath_color\fR to
\&\fBmold_color\fR with a step of \fBmold\fR. \fBmold\fR can have a

.PP
The filter is used to measure the difference between channels of stereo
audio stream. A monoaural signal, consisting of identical left and right
signal, results in straight vertical line. Any stereo separation is visible
as a deviation from this line, creating a Lissajous figure.
If the straight (or deviation from it) but horizontal line appears this

.Sh "concat"
.IX Subsection "concat"
Concatenate audio and video streams, joining them together one after the
other.
.PP
The filter works on segments of synchronized video and audio streams. All
segments must have the same number of streams of each type, and that will
also be the number of streams at output.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
Set the number of segments. Default is 2.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"
Set the number of output video streams, that is also the number of video
streams in each segment. Default is 1.
.IP "\fBa\fR" 4
.IX Item "a"
Set the number of output audio streams, that is also the number of audio
streams in each segment. Default is 0.
.IP "\fBunsafe\fR" 4
.IX Item "unsafe"
Activate unsafe mode: do not fail if segments have a different format.
.PP
The filter has \fIv\fR+\fIa\fR outputs: first \fIv\fR video outputs, then
\&\fIa\fR audio outputs.
.PP
There are \fIn\fRx(\fIv\fR+\fIa\fR) inputs: first the inputs for the first
segment, in the same order as the outputs, then the inputs for the second
segment, etc.
.PP
Related streams do not always have exactly the same duration, for various
reasons including codec frame size or sloppy authoring. For that reason,
related synchronized streams (e.g. a video and its audio track) should be
concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the duration of the longest
stream in each segment (except the last one), and if necessary pad shorter
audio streams with silence.
.PP
For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start at timestamp 0.
.PP

Temporally interleave frames from several inputs.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`interleave\*(C'\fR works with video inputs, \f(CW\*(C`ainterleave\*(C'\fR with audio.
.PP
These filters read frames from several inputs and send the oldest
queued frame to the output.
.PP
Input streams must have a well defined, monotonically increasing frame
timestamp values.
.PP
In order to submit one frame to output, these filters need to enqueue
at least one frame for each input, so they cannot work in case one
input is not yet terminated and will not receive incoming frames.
.PP
For example consider the case when one input is a \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR filter
which always drop input frames. The \f(CW\*(C`interleave\*(C'\fR filter will keep
reading from that input, but it will never be able to send new frames
to output until the input will send an end-of-stream signal.
.PP
Also, depending on inputs synchronization, the filters will drop
frames in case one input receives more frames than the other ones, and
the queue is already filled.

The following flags are recognized:
.IP "\fBenter\fR" 4

.IP "\fBleave\fR" 4
.IX Item "leave"
The command is sent when the current frame timestamp leaves the
specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
previous frame timestamp was in the given interval, and the
current is not.
.PP
If \fI\s-1FLAGS\s0\fR is not specified, a default value of \f(CW\*(C`[enter]\*(C'\fR is
assumed.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1TARGET\s0\fR specifies the target of the command, usually the name of

The name of the resource to read (not necessarily a file; it can also be a
device or a stream accessed through some protocol).
.IP "\fBformat_name, f\fR" 4
.IX Item "format_name, f"
Specifies the format assumed for the movie to read, and can be either
the name of a container or an input device. If not specified, the
format is guessed from \fImovie_name\fR or by probing.
.IP "\fBseek_point, sp\fR" 4
.IX Item "seek_point, sp"
Specifies the seek point in seconds. The frames will be output
starting from this seek point. The parameter is evaluated with

.IP "\fBstreams, s\fR" 4
.IX Item "streams, s"
Specifies the streams to read. Several streams can be specified,
separated by \*(L"+\*(R". The source will then have as many outputs, in the
same order. The syntax is explained in the ``Stream specifiers''
section in the ffmpeg manual. Two special names, \*(L"dv\*(R" and \*(L"da\*(R" specify
respectively the default (best suited) video and audio stream. Default

.IP "\fBstream_index, si\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream_index, si"
Specifies the index of the video stream to read. If the value is \-1,
the most suitable video stream will be automatically selected. The default
value is \*(L"\-1\*(R". Deprecated. If the filter is called \*(L"amovie\*(R", it will select
audio instead of video.

If the value is less than 1, the stream will be read again and again.
Default value is \*(L"1\*(R".
