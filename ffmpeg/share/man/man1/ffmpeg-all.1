ffmpeg \- ffmpeg video converter

.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
ffmpeg [\fIglobal_options\fR] {[\fIinput_file_options\fR] \-i \fIinput_file\fR} ... {[\fIoutput_file_options\fR] \fIoutput_file\fR} ...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBffmpeg\fR is a very fast video and audio converter that can also grab from
a live audio/video source. It can also convert between arbitrary sample
rates and resize video on the fly with a high quality polyphase filter.
.PP
\&\fBffmpeg\fR reads from an arbitrary number of input \*(L"files\*(R" (which can be regular
files, pipes, network streams, grabbing devices, etc.), specified by the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR option, and writes to an arbitrary number of output \*(L"files\*(R", which are
specified by a plain output filename. Anything found on the command line which
cannot be interpreted as an option is considered to be an output filename.
.PP
Each input or output file can, in principle, contain any number of streams of
different types (video/audio/subtitle/attachment/data). The allowed number and/or
types of streams may be limited by the container format. Selecting which
streams from which inputs will go into which output is either done automatically
or with the \f(CW\*(C`\-map\*(C'\fR option (see the Stream selection chapter).
.PP
To refer to input files in options, you must use their indices (0\-based). E.g.
the first input file is \f(CW0\fR, the second is \f(CW1\fR, etc. Similarly, streams
within a file are referred to by their indices. E.g. \f(CW\*(C`2:3\*(C'\fR refers to the
fourth stream in the third input file. Also see the Stream specifiers chapter.
.PP
As a general rule, options are applied to the next specified
file. Therefore, order is important, and you can have the same
option on the command line multiple times. Each occurrence is
then applied to the next input or output file.
Exceptions from this rule are the global options (e.g. verbosity level),
which should be specified first.
.PP
Do not mix input and output files \*(-- first specify all input files, then all
output files. Also do not mix options which belong to different files. All
options apply \s-1ONLY\s0 to the next input or output file and are reset between files.
.IP "\(bu" 4
To set the video bitrate of the output file to 64 kbit/s:

The transcoding process in \fBffmpeg\fR for each output can be described by
the following diagram:

.Ve
.PP
\&\fBffmpeg\fR calls the libavformat library (containing demuxers) to read
input files and get packets containing encoded data from them. When there are
multiple input files, \fBffmpeg\fR tries to keep them synchronized by
tracking lowest timestamp on any active input stream.
.PP
Encoded packets are then passed to the decoder (unless streamcopy is selected
for the stream, see further for a description). The decoder produces
uncompressed frames (raw video/PCM audio/...) which can be processed further by
filtering (see next section). After filtering, the frames are passed to the
encoder, which encodes them and outputs encoded packets. Finally those are
passed to the muxer, which writes the encoded packets to the output file.
.Sh "Filtering"
.IX Subsection "Filtering"
Before encoding, \fBffmpeg\fR can process raw audio and video frames using
filters from the libavfilter library. Several chained filters form a filter
graph. \fBffmpeg\fR distinguishes between two types of filtergraphs:
simple and complex.
.PP
\fISimple filtergraphs\fR
.IX Subsection "Simple filtergraphs"
.PP
Simple filtergraphs are those that have exactly one input and output, both of
the same type. In the above diagram they can be represented by simply inserting
an additional step between decoding and encoding:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&         _________                        ______________
\&        |         |                      |              |
\&        | decoded |                      | encoded data |
\&        | frames  |\e                   _ | packets      |
\&        |_________| \e                  /||______________|
\&                     \e   __________   /
\&          simple     _\e||          | /  encoder
\&          filtergraph   | filtered |/
\&                        | frames   |
\&                        |__________|
.Ve
.PP
Simple filtergraphs are configured with the per-stream \fB\-filter\fR option
(with \fB\-vf\fR and \fB\-af\fR aliases for video and audio respectively).
A simple filtergraph for video can look for example like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&         _______        _____________        _______        ________
\&        |       |      |             |      |       |      |        |
\&        | input | ---> | deinterlace | ---> | scale | ---> | output |
\&        |_______|      |_____________|      |_______|      |________|
.Ve
.PP
Note that some filters change frame properties but not frame contents. E.g. the
\&\f(CW\*(C`fps\*(C'\fR filter in the example above changes number of frames, but does not
touch the frame contents. Another example is the \f(CW\*(C`setpts\*(C'\fR filter, which
only sets timestamps and otherwise passes the frames unchanged.
.PP
\fIComplex filtergraphs\fR
.IX Subsection "Complex filtergraphs"
.PP
Complex filtergraphs are those which cannot be described as simply a linear
processing chain applied to one stream. This is the case, for example, when the graph has
more than one input and/or output, or when output stream type is different from
input. They can be represented with the following diagram:
.PP
.Vb 16
\&         _________
\&        |         |
\&        | input 0 |\e                    __________
\&        |_________| \e                  |          |
\&                     \e   _________    /| output 0 |
\&                      \e |         |  / |__________|
\&         _________     \e| complex | /
\&        |         |     |         |/
\&        | input 1 |---->| filter  |\e
\&        |_________|     |         | \e   __________
\&                       /| graph   |  \e |          |
\&                      / |         |   \e| output 1 |
\&         _________   /  |_________|    |__________|
\&        |         | /
\&        | input 2 |/
\&        |_________|
.Ve
.PP
Complex filtergraphs are configured with the \fB\-filter_complex\fR option.
Note that this option is global, since a complex filtergraph, by its nature,
cannot be unambiguously associated with a single stream or file.
.PP
The \fB\-lavfi\fR option is equivalent to \fB\-filter_complex\fR.
.PP
A trivial example of a complex filtergraph is the \f(CW\*(C`overlay\*(C'\fR filter, which
has two video inputs and one video output, containing one video overlaid on top
of the other. Its audio counterpart is the \f(CW\*(C`amix\*(C'\fR filter.
.Sh "Stream copy"
.IX Subsection "Stream copy"
Stream copy is a mode selected by supplying the \f(CW\*(C`copy\*(C'\fR parameter to the
\&\fB\-codec\fR option. It makes \fBffmpeg\fR omit the decoding and encoding
step for the specified stream, so it does only demuxing and muxing. It is useful
for changing the container format or modifying container-level metadata. The
diagram above will, in this case, simplify to this:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&         _______              ______________            ________
\&        |       |            |              |          |        |
\&        | input |  demuxer   | encoded data |  muxer   | output |
\&        | file  | ---------> | packets      | -------> | file   |
\&        |_______|            |______________|          |________|
.Ve
.PP
Since there is no decoding or encoding, it is very fast and there is no quality
loss. However, it might not work in some cases because of many factors. Applying
filters is obviously also impossible, since filters work on uncompressed data.
.SH "STREAM SELECTION"
.IX Header "STREAM SELECTION"
By default, \fBffmpeg\fR includes only one stream of each type (video, audio, subtitle)
present in the input files and adds them to each output file.  It picks the
\&\*(L"best\*(R" of each based upon the following criteria: for video, it is the stream
with the highest resolution, for audio, it is the stream with the most channels, for
subtitles, it is the first subtitle stream. In the case where several streams of
the same type rate equally, the stream with the lowest index is chosen.
.PP
You can disable some of those defaults by using the \f(CW\*(C`\-vn/\-an/\-sn\*(C'\fR options. For
full manual control, use the \f(CW\*(C`\-map\*(C'\fR option, which disables the defaults just
described.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a string
representing a number as input, which may be followed by one of the \s-1SI\s0
unit prefixes, for example: 'K', 'M', or 'G'.
.PP
If 'i' is appended to the \s-1SI\s0 unit prefix, the complete prefix will be
interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiples, which are based on
powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending 'B' to the \s-1SI\s0 unit
prefix multiplies the value by 8. This allows using, for example:
\&'\s-1KB\s0', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as number suffixes.
.PP
Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing
the option name with \*(L"no\*(R". For example using \*(L"\-nofoo\*(R"
will set the boolean option with name \*(L"foo\*(R" to false.
.Sh "Stream specifiers"
.IX Subsection "Stream specifiers"
Some options are applied per\-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream specifiers
are used to precisely specify which stream(s) a given option belongs to.
.PP
A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and
separated from it by a colon. E.g. \f(CW\*(C`\-codec:a:1 ac3\*(C'\fR contains the
\&\f(CW\*(C`a:1\*(C'\fR stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream. Therefore, it
would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.
.PP
A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is applied to all
of them. E.g. the stream specifier in \f(CW\*(C`\-b:a 128k\*(C'\fR matches all audio
streams.
.PP
An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, \f(CW\*(C`\-codec copy\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`\-codec: copy\*(C'\fR would copy all the streams without reencoding.
.PP
Possible forms of stream specifiers are:
.IP "\fIstream_index\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream_index"
Matches the stream with this index. E.g. \f(CW\*(C`\-threads:1 4\*(C'\fR would set the
thread count for the second stream to 4.
.IP "\fIstream_type\fR\fB[:\fR\fIstream_index\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream_type[:stream_index]"
\&\fIstream_type\fR is one of following: 'v' for video, 'a' for audio, 's' for subtitle,
\&'d' for data, and 't' for attachments. If \fIstream_index\fR is given, then it matches
stream number \fIstream_index\fR of this type. Otherwise, it matches all
streams of this type.
.IP "\fBp:\fR\fIprogram_id\fR\fB[:\fR\fIstream_index\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "p:program_id[:stream_index]"
If \fIstream_index\fR is given, then it matches the stream with number \fIstream_index\fR
in the program with the id \fIprogram_id\fR. Otherwise, it matches all streams in the
program.
.IP "\fB#\fR\fIstream_id\fR \fBor i:\fR\fIstream_id\fR" 4
.IX Item "#stream_id or i:stream_id"
Match the stream by stream id (e.g. \s-1PID\s0 in MPEG-TS container).
.IP "\fBm:\fR\fIkey\fR\fB[:\fR\fIvalue\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "m:key[:value]"
Matches streams with the metadata tag \fIkey\fR having the specified value. If
\&\fIvalue\fR is not given, matches streams that contain the given tag with any
value.
.Sp
Note that in \fBffmpeg\fR, matching by metadata will only work properly for
input files.

This option is used to benchmark all available OpenCL devices and print the
results. This option is only available when FFmpeg has been compiled with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-opencl\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
When FFmpeg is configured with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-opencl\*(C'\fR, the options for the
global OpenCL context are set via \fB\-opencl_options\fR. See the
\&\*(L"OpenCL Options\*(R" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual for the complete list of
supported options. Amongst others, these options include the ability to select
a specific platform and device to run the OpenCL code on. By default, FFmpeg
will run on the first device of the first platform. While the options for the
global OpenCL context provide flexibility to the user in selecting the OpenCL
device of their choice, most users would probably want to select the fastest
OpenCL device for their system.
.Sp
This option assists the selection of the most efficient configuration by
identifying the appropriate device for the user's system. The built-in
benchmark is run on all the OpenCL devices and the performance is measured for
each device. The devices in the results list are sorted based on their
performance with the fastest device listed first. The user can subsequently
invoke \fBffmpeg\fR using the device deemed most appropriate via
\&\fB\-opencl_options\fR to obtain the best performance for the OpenCL
accelerated code.
.Sp
Typical usage to use the fastest OpenCL device involve the following steps.
.Sp
Run the command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -opencl_bench
.Ve
.Sp
Note down the platform \s-1ID\s0 (\fIpidx\fR) and device \s-1ID\s0 (\fIdidx\fR) of the first

These options can be set for any container, codec or device. Generic options
are listed under AVFormatContext options for containers/devices and under
AVCodecContext options for codecs.
.IP "\fBprivate\fR" 4

These options are specific to the given container, device or codec. Private
options are listed under their corresponding containers/devices/codecs.
.PP
For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to
an \s-1MP3\s0 file, use the \fBid3v2_version\fR private option of the \s-1MP3\s0
muxer:
.PP
.Vb 1

All codec AVOptions are per\-stream, and thus a stream specifier

E.g. to extract the first attachment to a file named 'out.ttf':
.Sp
.Vb 1

Note that most acceleration methods are intended for playback and will not be

For example, if you have two audio streams in the first input file,
these streams are identified by \*(L"0:0\*(R" and \*(L"0:1\*(R". You can use

.Sp
Using \*(L"\-1\*(R" instead of

.Sp
For example, assuming \fI\s-1INPUT\s0\fR is a stereo audio file, you can switch the

.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i INPUT -map_channel 0.0.1 -map_channel 0.0.0 OUTPUT

.Ve
.Sp
The order of the \*(L"\-map_channel\*(R" option specifies the order of the channels in
the output stream. The output channel layout is guessed from the number of
channels mapped (mono if one \*(L"\-map_channel\*(R", stereo if two, etc.). Using \*(L"\-ac\*(R"
in combination of \*(L"\-map_channel\*(R" makes the channel gain levels to be updated if
input and output channel layouts don't match (for instance two \*(L"\-map_channel\*(R"
options and \*(L"\-ac 6\*(R").
.Sp
You can also extract each channel of an input to specific outputs; the following
command extracts two channels of the \fI\s-1INPUT\s0\fR audio stream (file 0, stream 0)
to the respective \fI\s-1OUTPUT_CH0\s0\fR and \fI\s-1OUTPUT_CH1\s0\fR outputs:

The following example splits the channels of a stereo input into two separate
streams, which are put into the same output file:

\&        ffmpeg -i stereo.wav -map 0:0 -map 0:0 -map_channel 0.0.0:0.0 -map_channel 0.0.1:0.1 -y out.ogg
.Ve
.Sp
Note that currently each output stream can only contain channels from a single
input stream; you can't for example use \*(L"\-map_channel\*(R" to pick multiple input
audio channels contained in different streams (from the same or different files)
and merge them into a single output stream. It is therefore not currently
possible, for example, to turn two separate mono streams into a single stereo
stream. However splitting a stereo stream into two single channel mono streams
is possible.

If you need this feature, a possible workaround is to use the \fIamerge\fR
filter. For example, if you need to merge a media (here \fIinput.mkv\fR) with 2
mono audio streams into one single stereo channel audio stream (and keep the
video stream), you can use the following command:

If metadata specifier is omitted, it defaults to global.
.Sp
By default, global metadata is copied from the first input file,
per-stream and per-chapter metadata is copied along with streams/chapters. These
default mappings are disabled by creating any mapping of the relevant type. A negative
file index can be used to create a dummy mapping that just disables automatic copying.
.Sp
For example to copy metadata from the first stream of the input file to global metadata
of the output file:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i in.ogg -map_metadata 0:s:0 out.mp3

To do the reverse, i.e. copy global metadata to all audio streams:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i in.mkv -map_metadata:s:a 0:g out.mkv

Output link labels are referred to with \fB\-map\fR. Unlabeled outputs are

.Sp
Here \f(CW\*(C`[0:v]\*(C'\fR refers to the first video stream in the first input file,
which is linked to the first (main) input of the overlay filter. Similarly the
first video stream in the second input is linked to the second (overlay) input

.Sh "Preset files"
.IX Subsection "Preset files"
A preset file contains a sequence of \fIoption\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs,
one for each line, specifying a sequence of options which would be
awkward to specify on the command line. Lines starting with the hash
('#') character are ignored and are used to provide comments. Check
the \fIpresets\fR directory in the FFmpeg source tree for examples.
.PP
There are two types of preset files: ffpreset and avpreset files.
.PP
\fIffpreset files\fR
.IX Subsection "ffpreset files"
.PP
ffpreset files are specified with the \f(CW\*(C`vpre\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`apre\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`spre\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`fpre\*(C'\fR options. The \f(CW\*(C`fpre\*(C'\fR option takes the
filename of the preset instead of a preset name as input and can be
used for any kind of codec. For the \f(CW\*(C`vpre\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`apre\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`spre\*(C'\fR options, the options specified in a preset file are
applied to the currently selected codec of the same type as the preset
option.
.PP
The argument passed to the \f(CW\*(C`vpre\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`apre\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`spre\*(C'\fR
preset options identifies the preset file to use according to the
following rules:
.PP
First ffmpeg searches for a file named \fIarg\fR.ffpreset in the
directories \fI$FFMPEG_DATADIR\fR (if set), and \fI$HOME/.ffmpeg\fR, and in
the datadir defined at configuration time (usually \fIPREFIX/share/ffmpeg\fR)
or in a \fIffpresets\fR folder along the executable on win32,
in that order. For example, if the argument is \f(CW\*(C`libvpx\-1080p\*(C'\fR, it will
search for the file \fIlibvpx\-1080p.ffpreset\fR.
.PP
If no such file is found, then ffmpeg will search for a file named
\&\fIcodec_name\fR\-\fIarg\fR.ffpreset in the above-mentioned
directories, where \fIcodec_name\fR is the name of the codec to which
the preset file options will be applied. For example, if you select
the video codec with \f(CW\*(C`\-vcodec libvpx\*(C'\fR and use \f(CW\*(C`\-vpre 1080p\*(C'\fR,
then it will search for the file \fIlibvpx\-1080p.ffpreset\fR.
.PP
\fIavpreset files\fR
.IX Subsection "avpreset files"
.PP
avpreset files are specified with the \f(CW\*(C`pre\*(C'\fR option. They work similar to
ffpreset files, but they only allow encoder\- specific options. Therefore, an
\&\fIoption\fR=\fIvalue\fR pair specifying an encoder cannot be used.
.PP
When the \f(CW\*(C`pre\*(C'\fR option is specified, ffmpeg will look for files with the
suffix .avpreset in the directories \fI$AVCONV_DATADIR\fR (if set), and
\&\fI$HOME/.avconv\fR, and in the datadir defined at configuration time (usually
\&\fIPREFIX/share/ffmpeg\fR), in that order.
.PP
First ffmpeg searches for a file named \fIcodec_name\fR\-\fIarg\fR.avpreset in
the above-mentioned directories, where \fIcodec_name\fR is the name of the codec
to which the preset file options will be applied. For example, if you select the
video codec with \f(CW\*(C`\-vcodec libvpx\*(C'\fR and use \f(CW\*(C`\-pre 1080p\*(C'\fR, then it will
search for the file \fIlibvpx\-1080p.avpreset\fR.
.PP
If no such file is found, then ffmpeg will search for a file named
\&\fIarg\fR.avpreset in the same directories.

For streaming at very low bitrates, use a low frame rate
and a small \s-1GOP\s0 size. This is especially true for RealVideo where
the Linux player does not seem to be very fast, so it can miss
frames. An example is:

.IP "\(bu" 4
The parameter 'q' which is displayed while encoding is the current
quantizer. The value 1 indicates that a very good quality could
be achieved. The value 31 indicates the worst quality. If q=31 appears
too often, it means that the encoder cannot compress enough to meet
your bitrate. You must either increase the bitrate, decrease the
frame rate or decrease the frame size.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If your computer is not fast enough, you can speed up the
compression at the expense of the compression ratio. You can use
\&'\-me zero' to speed up motion estimation, and '\-g 0' to disable
motion estimation completely (you have only I\-frames, which means it
is about as good as \s-1JPEG\s0 compression).

output an \s-1AVI\s0 file with \s-1MPEG\-4\s0 video and \s-1MP3\s0 audio. Note that in this
command we use B\-frames so the \s-1MPEG\-4\s0 stream is DivX5 compatible, and
\&\s-1GOP\s0 size is 300 which means one intra frame every 10 seconds for 29.97fps
input video. Furthermore, the audio stream is MP3\-encoded so you need
to enable \s-1LAME\s0 support by passing \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-libmp3lame\*(C'\fR to configure.
The mapping is particularly useful for \s-1DVD\s0 transcoding
to get the desired audio language.
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 To see the supported input formats, use \f(CW\*(C`ffmpeg \-formats\*(C'\fR.

You can extract images from a video, or create a video from many images:
.Sp
For extracting images from a video:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i foo.avi -r 1 -s WxH -f image2 foo-%03d.jpeg
.Ve
.Sp
This will extract one video frame per second from the video and will
output them in files named \fIfoo\-001.jpeg\fR, \fIfoo\-002.jpeg\fR,
etc. Images will be rescaled to fit the new WxH values.
.Sp
If you want to extract just a limited number of frames, you can use the
above command in combination with the \-vframes or \-t option, or in
combination with \-ss to start extracting from a certain point in time.
.Sp
For creating a video from many images:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -f image2 -i foo-%03d.jpeg -r 12 -s WxH foo.avi
.Ve
.Sp
The syntax \f(CW\*(C`foo\-%03d.jpeg\*(C'\fR specifies to use a decimal number
composed of three digits padded with zeroes to express the sequence
number. It is the same syntax supported by the C printf function, but
only formats accepting a normal integer are suitable.
.Sp
When importing an image sequence, \-i also supports expanding
shell-like wildcard patterns (globbing) internally, by selecting the
image2\-specific \f(CW\*(C`\-pattern_type glob\*(C'\fR option.
.Sp
For example, for creating a video from filenames matching the glob pattern
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo\-*.jpeg\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -f image2 -pattern_type glob -i 'foo-*.jpeg' -r 12 -s WxH foo.avi
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
You can put many streams of the same type in the output:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i test1.avi -i test2.avi -map 1:1 -map 1:0 -map 0:1 -map 0:0 -c copy -y test12.nut
.Ve
.Sp
The resulting output file \fItest12.nut\fR will contain the first four streams
from the input files in reverse order.
.IP "\(bu" 4
To force \s-1CBR\s0 video output:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -b 4000k -minrate 4000k -maxrate 4000k -bufsize 1835k out.m2v
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
The four options lmin, lmax, mblmin and mblmax use 'lambda' units,
but you may use the \s-1QP2LAMBDA\s0 constant to easily convert from 'q' units:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i src.ext -lmax 21*QP2LAMBDA dst.ext
.Ve
.SH "SYNTAX"
.IX Header "SYNTAX"
This section documents the syntax and formats employed by the FFmpeg
libraries and tools.
.Sh "Quoting and escaping"
.IX Subsection "Quoting and escaping"
FFmpeg adopts the following quoting and escaping mechanism, unless
explicitly specified. The following rules are applied:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`'\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR are special characters (respectively used for
quoting and escaping). In addition to them, there might be other
special characters depending on the specific syntax where the escaping
and quoting are employed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A special character is escaped by prefixing it with a '\e'.
.IP "\(bu" 4
All characters enclosed between '' are included literally in the
parsed string. The quote character \f(CW\*(C`'\*(C'\fR itself cannot be quoted,
so you may need to close the quote and escape it.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Leading and trailing whitespaces, unless escaped or quoted, are
removed from the parsed string.
.PP
Note that you may need to add a second level of escaping when using
the command line or a script, which depends on the syntax of the
adopted shell language.
.PP
The function \f(CW\*(C`av_get_token\*(C'\fR defined in
\&\fIlibavutil/avstring.h\fR can be used to parse a token quoted or
escaped according to the rules defined above.
.PP
The tool \fItools/ffescape\fR in the FFmpeg source tree can be used
to automatically quote or escape a string in a script.
.PP
\fIExamples\fR
.IX Subsection "Examples"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Escape the string \f(CW\*(C`Crime d'Amour\*(C'\fR containing the \f(CW\*(C`'\*(C'\fR special
character:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        Crime d\e'Amour
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
The string above contains a quote, so the \f(CW\*(C`'\*(C'\fR needs to be escaped
when quoting it:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        'Crime d'\e''Amour'
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Include leading or trailing whitespaces using quoting:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        '  this string starts and ends with whitespaces  '
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Escaping and quoting can be mixed together:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ' The string '\e'string\e'' is a string '
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
To include a literal \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR you can use either escaping or quoting:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        'c:\efoo' can be written as c:\e\efoo
.Ve
.Sh "Date"
.IX Subsection "Date"
The accepted syntax is:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        [(YYYY-MM-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH:MM:SS[.m...]]])|(HHMMSS[.m...]]]))[Z]
\&        now
.Ve
.PP
If the value is \*(L"now\*(R" it takes the current time.
.PP
Time is local time unless Z is appended, in which case it is
interpreted as \s-1UTC\s0.
If the year-month-day part is not specified it takes the current
year\-month\-day.
.Sh "Time duration"
.IX Subsection "Time duration"
There are two accepted syntaxes for expressing time duration.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        [-][<HH>:]<MM>:<SS>[.<m>...]
.Ve
.PP
\&\fI\s-1HH\s0\fR expresses the number of hours, \fI\s-1MM\s0\fR the number of minutes
for a maximum of 2 digits, and \fI\s-1SS\s0\fR the number of seconds for a
maximum of 2 digits. The \fIm\fR at the end expresses decimal value for
\&\fI\s-1SS\s0\fR.
.PP
\&\fIor\fR
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        [-]<S>+[.<m>...]
.Ve
.PP
\&\fIS\fR expresses the number of seconds, with the optional decimal part
\&\fIm\fR.
.PP
In both expressions, the optional \fB\-\fR indicates negative duration.
.PP

A custom channel layout can be specified as a sequence of terms, separated by
\&'+' or '|'. Each term can be:
.IP "\(bu" 4
the name of a standard channel layout (e.g. \fBmono\fR,
\&\fBstereo\fR, \fB4.0\fR, \fBquad\fR, \fB5.0\fR, etc.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
the name of a single channel (e.g. \fB\s-1FL\s0\fR, \fB\s-1FR\s0\fR, \fB\s-1FC\s0\fR, \fB\s-1LFE\s0\fR, etc.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
a number of channels, in decimal, optionally followed by 'c', yielding
the default channel layout for that number of channels (see the

.SH "EXPRESSION EVALUATION"
.IX Header "EXPRESSION EVALUATION"
When evaluating an arithmetic expression, FFmpeg uses an internal
formula evaluator, implemented through the \fIlibavutil/eval.h\fR
interface.
.PP
An expression may contain unary, binary operators, constants, and
functions.
.PP
Two expressions \fIexpr1\fR and \fIexpr2\fR can be combined to form
another expression "\fIexpr1\fR;\fIexpr2\fR".
\&\fIexpr1\fR and \fIexpr2\fR are evaluated in turn, and the new
expression evaluates to the value of \fIexpr2\fR.
.PP
The following binary operators are available: \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The following unary operators are available: \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR.

Find an input value for which the function represented by \fIexpr\fR
with argument \fI\fIld\fI\|(0)\fR is 0 in the interval 0..\fImax\fR.
.Sp
The expression in \fIexpr\fR must denote a continuous function or the
result is undefined.
.Sp
\&\fI\fIld\fI\|(0)\fR is used to represent the function input value, which means
that the given expression will be evaluated multiple times with
various input values that the expression can access through
\&\f(CWld(0)\fR. When the expression evaluates to 0 then the
corresponding input value will be returned.
.IP "\fBsin(x)\fR" 4

.PD
Evaluate a Taylor series at \fIx\fR, given an expression representing
the \f(CW\*(C`ld(id)\*(C'\fR\-th derivative of a function at 0.
.Sp
When the series does not converge the result is undefined.

\&\fIld(id)\fR is used to represent the derivative order in \fIexpr\fR,
which means that the given expression will be evaluated multiple times
with various input values that the expression can access through
\&\f(CW\*(C`ld(id)\*(C'\fR. If \fIid\fR is not specified then 0 is assumed.
.Sp

.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR works like \s-1AND\s0
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR works like \s-1OR\s0
.PP
For example the construct:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        if (A AND B) then C
.Ve
.PP
is equivalent to:
.PP

.Ve
.PP
In your C code, you can extend the list of unary and binary functions,
and define recognized constants, so that they are available for your
expressions.
.PP
The evaluator also recognizes the International System unit prefixes.
If 'i' is appended after the prefix, binary prefixes are used, which
are based on powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000.
The 'B' postfix multiplies the value by 8, and can be appended after a
unit prefix or used alone. This allows using for example '\s-1KB\s0', 'MiB',
\&'G' and 'B' as number postfix.
.PP
The list of available International System prefixes follows, with
indication of the corresponding powers of 10 and of 2.

.SH "OPENCL OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPENCL OPTIONS"
When FFmpeg is configured with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-opencl\*(C'\fR, it is possible
to set the options for the global OpenCL context.
.PP
The list of supported options follows:
.IP "\fBbuild_options\fR" 4
.IX Item "build_options"
Set build options used to compile the registered kernels.
.Sp
See reference \*(L"OpenCL Specification Version: 1.2 chapter 5.6.4\*(R".
.IP "\fBplatform_idx\fR" 4
.IX Item "platform_idx"
Select the index of the platform to run OpenCL code.
.Sp
The specified index must be one of the indexes in the device list
which can be obtained with \f(CW\*(C`ffmpeg \-opencl_bench\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`av_opencl_get_device_list()\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBdevice_idx\fR" 4
.IX Item "device_idx"
Select the index of the device used to run OpenCL code.
.Sp
The specified index must be one of the indexes in the device list which
can be obtained with \f(CW\*(C`ffmpeg \-opencl_bench\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`av_opencl_get_device_list()\*(C'\fR.
.SH "CODEC OPTIONS"
.IX Header "CODEC OPTIONS"
libavcodec provides some generic global options, which can be set on
all the encoders and decoders. In addition each codec may support
so-called private options, which are specific for a given codec.
.PP
Sometimes, a global option may only affect a specific kind of codec,
and may be nonsensical or ignored by another, so you need to be aware
of the meaning of the specified options. Also some options are
meant only for decoding or encoding.
.PP
Options may be set by specifying \-\fIoption\fR \fIvalue\fR in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`AVCodecContext\*(C'\fR options or using the \fIlibavutil/opt.h\fR \s-1API\s0
for programmatic use.
.PP
The list of supported options follow:

always faster, just that one or the other may be better suited to a
particular system. The floating-point encoder will generally produce better
quality audio for a given bitrate. The \fIac3_fixed\fR encoder is not the
default codec for any of the output formats, so it must be specified explicitly
using the option \f(CW\*(C`\-acodec ac3_fixed\*(C'\fR in order to use it.

\fI\s-1AC\-3\s0 Metadata\fR
.IX Subsection "AC-3 Metadata"
.PP
The \s-1AC\-3\s0 metadata options are used to set parameters that describe the audio,
but in most cases do not affect the audio encoding itself. Some of the options
do directly affect or influence the decoding and playback of the resulting
bitstream, while others are just for informational purposes. A few of the
options will add bits to the output stream that could otherwise be used for
audio data, and will thus affect the quality of the output. Those will be
indicated accordingly with a note in the option list below.
.PP
These parameters are described in detail in several publicly-available
documents.

Shine Fixed-Point \s-1MP3\s0 encoder wrapper.
.PP
Shine is a fixed-point \s-1MP3\s0 encoder. It has a far better performance on
platforms without an \s-1FPU\s0, e.g. armel CPUs, and some phones and tablets.
However, as it is more targeted on performance than quality, it is not on par
with \s-1LAME\s0 and other production-grade encoders quality\-wise. Also, according to
the project's homepage, this encoder may not be free of bugs as the code was
written a long time ago and the project was dead for at least 5 years.

.Sh "libwebp"
.IX Subsection "libwebp"
libwebp WebP Image encoder wrapper
.PP
libwebp is Google's official encoder for WebP images. It can encode in either
lossy or lossless mode. Lossy images are essentially a wrapper around a \s-1VP8\s0
frame. Lossless images are a separate codec developed by Google.
.PP
\fIPixel Format\fR
.IX Subsection "Pixel Format"
.PP
Currently, libwebp only supports \s-1YUV420\s0 for lossy and \s-1RGB\s0 for lossless due
to limitations of the format and libwebp. Alpha is supported for either mode.
Because of \s-1API\s0 limitations, if \s-1RGB\s0 is passed in when encoding lossy or \s-1YUV\s0 is
passed in for encoding lossless, the pixel format will automatically be
converted using functions from libwebp. This is not ideal and is done only for
convenience.
.PP
\fIOptions\fR
.IX Subsection "Options"
.IP "\fB\-lossless\fR \fIboolean\fR" 4
.IX Item "-lossless boolean"
Enables/Disables use of lossless mode. Default is 0.
.IP "\fB\-compression_level\fR \fIinteger\fR" 4
.IX Item "-compression_level integer"
For lossy, this is a quality/speed tradeoff. Higher values give better quality
for a given size at the cost of increased encoding time. For lossless, this is
a size/speed tradeoff. Higher values give smaller size at the cost of increased
encoding time. More specifically, it controls the number of extra algorithms
and compression tools used, and varies the combination of these tools. This
maps to the \fImethod\fR option in libwebp. The valid range is 0 to 6.
Default is 4.
.IP "\fB\-qscale\fR \fIfloat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-qscale float"
For lossy encoding, this controls image quality, 0 to 100. For lossless
encoding, this controls the effort and time spent at compressing more. The
default value is 75. Note that for usage via libavcodec, this option is called
\&\fIglobal_quality\fR and must be multiplied by \fI\s-1FF_QP2LAMBDA\s0\fR.

.Sh "libx264, libx264rgb"
.IX Subsection "libx264, libx264rgb"
x264 H.264/MPEG\-4 \s-1AVC\s0 encoder wrapper.
.PP
This encoder requires the presence of the libx264 headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-libx264\*(C'\fR.
.PP
libx264 supports an impressive number of features, including 8x8 and
4x4 adaptive spatial transform, adaptive B\-frame placement, \s-1CAVLC/CABAC\s0
entropy coding, interlacing (\s-1MBAFF\s0), lossless mode, psy optimizations
for detail retention (adaptive quantization, psy\-RD, psy\-trellis).
.PP
Many libx264 encoder options are mapped to FFmpeg global codec
options, while unique encoder options are provided through private
options. Additionally the \fBx264opts\fR and \fBx264\-params\fR
private options allows one to pass a list of key=value tuples as accepted
by the libx264 \f(CW\*(C`x264_param_parse\*(C'\fR function.
.PP
The x264 project website is at
<\fBhttp://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html\fR>.
.PP
The libx264rgb encoder is the same as libx264, except it accepts packed \s-1RGB\s0
pixel formats as input instead of \s-1YUV\s0.
.PP
\fISupported Pixel Formats\fR
.IX Subsection "Supported Pixel Formats"
.PP
x264 supports 8\- to 10\-bit color spaces. The exact bit depth is controlled at
x264's configure time. FFmpeg only supports one bit depth in one particular
build. In other words, it is not possible to build one FFmpeg with multiple
versions of x264 with different bit depths.
.PP
\fIOptions\fR
.IX Subsection "Options"
.PP
The following options are supported by the libx264 wrapper. The
\&\fBx264\fR\-equivalent options or values are listed in parentheses
for easy migration.
.PP
To reduce the duplication of documentation, only the private options
and some others requiring special attention are documented here. For
the documentation of the undocumented generic options, see
\&\fBthe Codec Options chapter\fR.

demuxer may support so-called private options, which are specific for
that component.
.PP
Options may be set by specifying \-\fIoption\fR \fIvalue\fR in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`AVFormatContext\*(C'\fR options or using the \fIlibavutil/opt.h\fR \s-1API\s0
for programmatic use.
.PP
The list of supported options follows:

.SH "DEMUXERS"
.IX Header "DEMUXERS"
Demuxers are configured elements in FFmpeg that can read the
multimedia streams from a particular type of file.
.PP
When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported demuxers
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-list\-demuxers\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You can disable all the demuxers using the configure option
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-disable\-demuxers\*(C'\fR, and selectively enable a single demuxer with

.PP
The option \f(CW\*(C`\-formats\*(C'\fR of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled demuxers.
.PP
The description of some of the currently available demuxers follows.
.Sh "applehttp"
.IX Subsection "applehttp"
Apple \s-1HTTP\s0 Live Streaming demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer presents all AVStreams from all variant streams.
The id field is set to the bitrate variant index number. By setting
the discard flags on AVStreams (by pressing 'a' or 'v' in ffplay),
the caller can decide which variant streams to actually receive.
The total bitrate of the variant that the stream belongs to is
available in a metadata key named \*(L"variant_bitrate\*(R".
.Sh "apng"
.IX Subsection "apng"
Animated Portable Network Graphics demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer is used to demux \s-1APNG\s0 files.
All headers, but the \s-1PNG\s0 signature, up to (but not including) the first
fcTL chunk are transmitted as extradata.
Frames are then split as being all the chunks between two fcTL ones, or
between the last fcTL and \s-1IEND\s0 chunks.
.IP "\fB\-ignore_loop\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ignore_loop bool"
Ignore the loop variable in the file if set.
.IP "\fB\-max_fps\fR \fIint\fR" 4
.IX Item "-max_fps int"
Maximum framerate in frames per second (0 for no limit).
.IP "\fB\-default_fps\fR \fIint\fR" 4
.IX Item "-default_fps int"
Default framerate in frames per second when none is specified in the file
(0 meaning as fast as possible).
.Sh "asf"
.IX Subsection "asf"
Advanced Systems Format demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer is used to demux \s-1ASF\s0 files and \s-1MMS\s0 network streams.
.IP "\fB\-no_resync_search\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no_resync_search bool"
Do not try to resynchronize by looking for a certain optional start code.
.Sh "concat"
.IX Subsection "concat"
Virtual concatenation script demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer reads a list of files and other directives from a text file and
demuxes them one after the other, as if all their packet had been muxed
together.
.PP
The timestamps in the files are adjusted so that the first file starts at 0
and each next file starts where the previous one finishes. Note that it is
done globally and may cause gaps if all streams do not have exactly the same
length.
.PP
All files must have the same streams (same codecs, same time base, etc.).
.PP
The duration of each file is used to adjust the timestamps of the next file:
if the duration is incorrect (because it was computed using the bit-rate or
because the file is truncated, for example), it can cause artifacts. The
\&\f(CW\*(C`duration\*(C'\fR directive can be used to override the duration stored in
each file.
.PP
\fISyntax\fR
.IX Subsection "Syntax"
.PP
The script is a text file in extended\-ASCII, with one directive per line.
Empty lines, leading spaces and lines starting with '#' are ignored. The
following directive is recognized:
.ie n .IP "\fB\fB""file \f(BIpath\f(CB""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBfile \f(CBpath\f(CB\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "file path"
Path to a file to read; special characters and spaces must be escaped with
backslash or single quotes.
.Sp
All subsequent file-related directives apply to that file.
.ie n .IP "\fB\fB""ffconcat version 1.0""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBffconcat version 1.0\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "ffconcat version 1.0"
Identify the script type and version. It also sets the \fBsafe\fR option
to 1 if it was to its default \-1.
.Sp
To make FFmpeg recognize the format automatically, this directive must
appears exactly as is (no extra space or byte\-order\-mark) on the very first
line of the script.
.ie n .IP "\fB\fB""duration \f(BIdur\f(CB""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBduration \f(CBdur\f(CB\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "duration dur"
Duration of the file. This information can be specified from the file;
specifying it here may be more efficient or help if the information from the
file is not available or accurate.
.Sp
If the duration is set for all files, then it is possible to seek in the
whole concatenated video.
.ie n .IP "\fB\fB""stream""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBstream\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream"
Introduce a stream in the virtual file.
All subsequent stream-related directives apply to the last introduced
stream.
Some streams properties must be set in order to allow identifying the
matching streams in the subfiles.
If no streams are defined in the script, the streams from the first file are
copied.
.ie n .IP "\fB\fB""exact_stream_id \f(BIid\f(CB""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBexact_stream_id \f(CBid\f(CB\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "exact_stream_id id"
Set the id of the stream.
If this directive is given, the string with the corresponding id in the
subfiles will be used.
This is especially useful for MPEG-PS (\s-1VOB\s0) files, where the order of the
streams is not reliable.
.PP
\fIOptions\fR
.IX Subsection "Options"
.PP
This demuxer accepts the following option:
.IP "\fBsafe\fR" 4
.IX Item "safe"
If set to 1, reject unsafe file paths. A file path is considered safe if it
does not contain a protocol specification and is relative and all components
only contain characters from the portable character set (letters, digits,
period, underscore and hyphen) and have no period at the beginning of a
component.
.Sp
If set to 0, any file name is accepted.
.Sp
The default is \-1, it is equivalent to 1 if the format was automatically
probed and 0 otherwise.
.IP "\fBauto_convert\fR" 4
.IX Item "auto_convert"
If set to 1, try to perform automatic conversions on packet data to make the
streams concatenable.
.Sp
Currently, the only conversion is adding the h264_mp4toannexb bitstream
filter to H.264 streams in \s-1MP4\s0 format. This is necessary in particular if
there are resolution changes.
.Sh "flv"
.IX Subsection "flv"
Adobe Flash Video Format demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer is used to demux \s-1FLV\s0 files and \s-1RTMP\s0 network streams.
.IP "\fB\-flv_metadata\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flv_metadata bool"
Allocate the streams according to the onMetaData array content.

.IX Subsection "libgme"
The Game Music Emu library is a collection of video game music file emulators.
.PP
See <\fBhttp://code.google.com/p/game\-music\-emu/\fR> for more information.
.PP
Some files have multiple tracks. The demuxer will pick the first track by
default. The \fBtrack_index\fR option can be used to select a different
track. Track indexes start at 0. The demuxer exports the number of tracks as
\&\fItracks\fR meta data entry.
.PP
For very large files, the \fBmax_size\fR option may have to be adjusted.
.Sh "libquvi"
.IX Subsection "libquvi"
Play media from Internet services using the quvi project.
.PP
The demuxer accepts a \fBformat\fR option to request a specific quality. It
is by default set to \fIbest\fR.
.PP
See <\fBhttp://quvi.sourceforge.net/\fR> for more information.

.Sh "gif"
.IX Subsection "gif"
Animated \s-1GIF\s0 demuxer.
.PP
It accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBmin_delay\fR" 4
.IX Item "min_delay"
Set the minimum valid delay between frames in hundredths of seconds.
Range is 0 to 6000. Default value is 2.
.IP "\fBdefault_delay\fR" 4
.IX Item "default_delay"
Set the default delay between frames in hundredths of seconds.
Range is 0 to 6000. Default value is 10.
.IP "\fBignore_loop\fR" 4
.IX Item "ignore_loop"
\&\s-1GIF\s0 files can contain information to loop a certain number of times (or
infinitely). If \fBignore_loop\fR is set to 1, then the loop setting
from the input will be ignored and looping will not occur. If set to 0,
then looping will occur and will cycle the number of times according to
the \s-1GIF\s0. Default value is 1.
.PP
For example, with the overlay filter, place an infinitely looping \s-1GIF\s0
over another video:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ignore_loop 0 -i input.gif -filter_complex overlay=shortest=1 out.mkv
.Ve
.PP
Note that in the above example the shortest option for overlay filter is
used to end the output video at the length of the shortest input file,
which in this case is \fIinput.mp4\fR as the \s-1GIF\s0 in this example loops
infinitely.
.Sh "image2"
.IX Subsection "image2"
Image file demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer reads from a list of image files specified by a pattern.
The syntax and meaning of the pattern is specified by the
option \fIpattern_type\fR.
.PP
The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the images contained in the files.
.PP
The size, the pixel format, and the format of each image must be the
same for all the files in the sequence.
.PP
This demuxer accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBframerate\fR" 4
.IX Item "framerate"
Set the frame rate for the video stream. It defaults to 25.
.IP "\fBloop\fR" 4
.IX Item "loop"
If set to 1, loop over the input. Default value is 0.
.IP "\fBpattern_type\fR" 4
.IX Item "pattern_type"
Select the pattern type used to interpret the provided filename.
.Sp
\&\fIpattern_type\fR accepts one of the following values.
.RS 4
.IP "\fBsequence\fR" 4
.IX Item "sequence"
Select a sequence pattern type, used to specify a sequence of files
indexed by sequential numbers.
.Sp
A sequence pattern may contain the string \*(L"%d\*(R" or "%0\fIN\fRd\*(L", which
specifies the position of the characters representing a sequential
number in each filename matched by the pattern. If the form
\&\*(R"%d0\fIN\fRd" is used, the string representing the number in each
filename is 0\-padded and \fIN\fR is the total number of 0\-padded
digits representing the number. The literal character '%' can be
specified in the pattern with the string \*(L"%%\*(R".
.Sp
If the sequence pattern contains \*(L"%d\*(R" or "%0\fIN\fRd", the first filename of
the file list specified by the pattern must contain a number
inclusively contained between \fIstart_number\fR and
\&\fIstart_number\fR+\fIstart_number_range\fR\-1, and all the following
numbers must be sequential.
.Sp
For example the pattern \*(L"img\-%03d.bmp\*(R" will match a sequence of
filenames of the form \fIimg\-001.bmp\fR, \fIimg\-002.bmp\fR, ...,
\&\fIimg\-010.bmp\fR, etc.; the pattern \*(L"i%%m%%g\-%d.jpg\*(R" will match a
sequence of filenames of the form \fIi%m%g\-1.jpg\fR,
\&\fIi%m%g\-2.jpg\fR, ..., \fIi%m%g\-10.jpg\fR, etc.
.Sp
Note that the pattern must not necessarily contain \*(L"%d\*(R" or
"%0\fIN\fRd", for example to convert a single image file
\&\fIimg.jpeg\fR you can employ the command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i img.jpeg img.png
.Ve
.IP "\fBglob\fR" 4
.IX Item "glob"
Select a glob wildcard pattern type.
.Sp
The pattern is interpreted like a \f(CW\*(C`glob()\*(C'\fR pattern. This is only
selectable if libavformat was compiled with globbing support.
.IP "\fBglob_sequence\fR \fI(deprecated, will be removed)\fR" 4
.IX Item "glob_sequence (deprecated, will be removed)"
Select a mixed glob wildcard/sequence pattern.
.Sp
If your version of libavformat was compiled with globbing support, and
the provided pattern contains at least one glob meta character among
\&\f(CW\*(C`%*?[]{}\*(C'\fR that is preceded by an unescaped \*(L"%\*(R", the pattern is
interpreted like a \f(CW\*(C`glob()\*(C'\fR pattern, otherwise it is interpreted
like a sequence pattern.
.Sp
All glob special characters \f(CW\*(C`%*?[]{}\*(C'\fR must be prefixed
with \*(L"%\*(R". To escape a literal \*(L"%\*(R" you shall use \*(L"%%\*(R".
.Sp
For example the pattern \f(CW\*(C`foo\-%*.jpeg\*(C'\fR will match all the
filenames prefixed by \*(L"foo\-\*(R" and terminating with \*(L".jpeg\*(R", and
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo\-%?%?%?.jpeg\*(C'\fR will match all the filenames prefixed with
\&\*(L"foo\-\*(R", followed by a sequence of three characters, and terminating
with \*(L".jpeg\*(R".

This demuxer allows one to read raw video data. Since there is no header
specifying the assumed video parameters, the user must specify them
in order to be able to decode the data correctly.

SBaGen script demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer reads the script language used by SBaGen
<\fBhttp://uazu.net/sbagen/\fR> to generate binaural beats sessions. A \s-1SBG\s0
script looks like that:
.PP
.Vb 9

\&        +0:21:00 == b
\&        +0:30:00    off
.Ve
.PP
A \s-1SBG\s0 script can mix absolute and relative timestamps. If the script uses
either only absolute timestamps (including the script start time) or only
relative ones, then its layout is fixed, and the conversion is
straightforward. On the other hand, if the script mixes both kind of
timestamps, then the \fI\s-1NOW\s0\fR reference for relative timestamps will be
taken from the current time of day at the time the script is read, and the
script layout will be frozen according to that reference. That means that if
the script is directly played, the actual times will match the absolute
timestamps up to the sound controller's clock accuracy, but if the user
somehow pauses the playback or seeks, all times will be shifted accordingly.

.IP "\fBhls_flags single_file\fR" 4
.IX Item "hls_flags single_file"
If this flag is set, the muxer will store all segments in a single MPEG-TS
file, and will use byte ranges in the playlist. \s-1HLS\s0 playlists generated with
this way will have the version number 4.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1

Image file muxer.
.PP
The image file muxer writes video frames to image files.
.PP
The output filenames are specified by a pattern, which can be used to
produce sequentially numbered series of files.
The pattern may contain the string \*(L"%d\*(R" or "%0\fIN\fRd\*(L", this string
specifies the position of the characters representing a numbering in
the filenames. If the form \*(R"%0\fIN\fRd" is used, the string
representing the number in each filename is 0\-padded to \fIN\fR
digits. The literal character '%' can be specified in the pattern with
the string \*(L"%%\*(R".
.PP
If the pattern contains \*(L"%d\*(R" or "%0\fIN\fRd", the first filename of
the file list specified will contain the number 1, all the following
numbers will be sequential.
.PP
The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the image files to write.
.PP
For example the pattern \*(L"img\-%03d.bmp\*(R" will specify a sequence of
filenames of the form \fIimg\-001.bmp\fR, \fIimg\-002.bmp\fR, ...,
\&\fIimg\-010.bmp\fR, etc.
The pattern \*(L"img%%\-%d.jpg\*(R" will specify a sequence of filenames of the
form \fIimg%\-1.jpg\fR, \fIimg%\-2.jpg\fR, ..., \fIimg%\-10.jpg\fR,
etc.

.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i in.avi -vsync 1 -r 1 -f image2 'img-%03d.jpeg'
.Ve
.PP
Note that with \fBffmpeg\fR, if the format is not specified with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR option and the output filename specifies an image file
format, the image2 muxer is automatically selected, so the previous
command can be written as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i in.avi -vsync 1 -r 1 'img-%03d.jpeg'
.Ve
.PP
Note also that the pattern must not necessarily contain \*(L"%d\*(R" or
"%0\fIN\fRd", for example to create a single image file
\&\fIimg.jpeg\fR from the input video you can employ the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i in.avi -f image2 -frames:v 1 img.jpeg

This muxer supports the following options:
.IP "\fBreserve_index_space\fR" 4
.IX Item "reserve_index_space"
By default, this muxer writes the index for seeking (called cues in Matroska
terms) at the end of the file, because it cannot know in advance how much space
to leave for the index at the beginning of the file. However for some use cases
\&\*(-- e.g.  streaming where seeking is possible but slow \*(-- it is useful to put the
index at the beginning of the file.
.Sp
If this option is set to a non-zero value, the muxer will reserve a given amount
of space in the file header and then try to write the cues there when the muxing
finishes. If the available space does not suffice, muxing will fail. A safe size
for most use cases should be about 50kB per hour of video.
.Sp
Note that cues are only written if the output is seekable and this option will
have no effect if it is not.
.Sh "md5"
.IX Subsection "md5"
\&\s-1MD5\s0 testing format.
.PP
This muxer computes and prints the \s-1MD5\s0 hash of all the input audio
and video frames. By default audio frames are converted to signed
16\-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the
hash.
.PP
The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form:
MD5=\fI\s-1MD5\s0\fR, where \fI\s-1MD5\s0\fR is a hexadecimal number representing
the computed \s-1MD5\s0 hash.
.PP
For example to compute the \s-1MD5\s0 hash of the input converted to raw
audio and video, and store it in the file \fIout.md5\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 out.md5
.Ve
.PP
You can print the \s-1MD5\s0 to stdout with the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 -
.Ve
.PP

.Sh "mov, mp4, ismv"
.IX Subsection "mov, mp4, ismv"
\&\s-1MOV/MP4/ISMV\s0 (Smooth Streaming) muxer.
.PP
The mov/mp4/ismv muxer supports fragmentation. Normally, a \s-1MOV/MP4\s0
file has all the metadata about all packets stored in one location
(written at the end of the file, it can be moved to the start for
better playback by adding \fIfaststart\fR to the \fImovflags\fR, or
using the \fBqt-faststart\fR tool). A fragmented
file consists of a number of fragments, where packets and metadata
about these packets are stored together. Writing a fragmented
file has the advantage that the file is decodable even if the
writing is interrupted (while a normal \s-1MOV/MP4\s0 is undecodable if
it is not properly finished), and it requires less memory when writing
very long files (since writing normal \s-1MOV/MP4\s0 files stores info about
every single packet in memory until the file is closed). The downside
is that it is less compatible with other applications.
.PP
\fIOptions\fR
.IX Subsection "Options"
.PP
Fragmentation is enabled by setting one of the AVOptions that define
how to cut the file into fragments:
.IP "\fB\-moov_size\fR \fIbytes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-moov_size bytes"
Reserves space for the moov atom at the beginning of the file instead of placing the
moov atom at the end. If the space reserved is insufficient, muxing will fail.
.IP "\fB\-movflags frag_keyframe\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags frag_keyframe"
Start a new fragment at each video keyframe.
.IP "\fB\-frag_duration\fR \fIduration\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frag_duration duration"
Create fragments that are \fIduration\fR microseconds long.
.IP "\fB\-frag_size\fR \fIsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frag_size size"
Create fragments that contain up to \fIsize\fR bytes of payload data.
.IP "\fB\-movflags frag_custom\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags frag_custom"
Allow the caller to manually choose when to cut fragments, by
calling \f(CW\*(C`av_write_frame(ctx, NULL)\*(C'\fR to write a fragment with
the packets written so far. (This is only useful with other
applications integrating libavformat, not from \fBffmpeg\fR.)
.IP "\fB\-min_frag_duration\fR \fIduration\fR" 4
.IX Item "-min_frag_duration duration"
Don't create fragments that are shorter than \fIduration\fR microseconds long.
.PP
If more than one condition is specified, fragments are cut when
one of the specified conditions is fulfilled. The exception to this is
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-min_frag_duration\*(C'\fR, which has to be fulfilled for any of the other
conditions to apply.
.PP
Additionally, the way the output file is written can be adjusted
through a few other options:
.IP "\fB\-movflags empty_moov\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags empty_moov"
Write an initial moov atom directly at the start of the file, without
describing any samples in it. Generally, an mdat/moov pair is written
at the start of the file, as a normal \s-1MOV/MP4\s0 file, containing only
a short portion of the file. With this option set, there is no initial
mdat atom, and the moov atom only describes the tracks but has
a zero duration.
.Sp
This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.
.IP "\fB\-movflags separate_moof\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags separate_moof"
Write a separate moof (movie fragment) atom for each track. Normally,
packets for all tracks are written in a moof atom (which is slightly
more efficient), but with this option set, the muxer writes one moof/mdat
pair for each track, making it easier to separate tracks.
.Sp
This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.
.IP "\fB\-movflags faststart\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags faststart"
Run a second pass moving the index (moov atom) to the beginning of the file.
This operation can take a while, and will not work in various situations such
as fragmented output, thus it is not enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-movflags rtphint\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags rtphint"
Add \s-1RTP\s0 hinting tracks to the output file.
.IP "\fB\-movflags disable_chpl\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags disable_chpl"
Disable Nero chapter markers (chpl atom).  Normally, both Nero chapters
and a QuickTime chapter track are written to the file. With this option
set, only the QuickTime chapter track will be written. Nero chapters can
cause failures when the file is reprocessed with certain tagging programs, like
mp3Tag 2.61a and iTunes 11.3, most likely other versions are affected as well.
.IP "\fB\-movflags omit_tfhd_offset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags omit_tfhd_offset"
Do not write any absolute base_data_offset in tfhd atoms. This avoids
tying fragments to absolute byte positions in the file/streams.
.IP "\fB\-movflags default_base_moof\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags default_base_moof"
Similarly to the omit_tfhd_offset, this flag avoids writing the
absolute base_data_offset field in tfhd atoms, but does so by using
the new default-base-is-moof flag instead. This flag is new from
14496\-12:2012. This may make the fragments easier to parse in certain
circumstances (avoiding basing track fragment location calculations
on the implicit end of the previous track fragment).

.Sh "mp3"
.IX Subsection "mp3"
The \s-1MP3\s0 muxer writes a raw \s-1MP3\s0 stream with the following optional features:
.IP "\(bu" 4
An ID3v2 metadata header at the beginning (enabled by default). Versions 2.3 and
2.4 are supported, the \f(CW\*(C`id3v2_version\*(C'\fR private option controls which one is
used (3 or 4). Setting \f(CW\*(C`id3v2_version\*(C'\fR to 0 disables the ID3v2 header
completely.
.Sp
The muxer supports writing attached pictures (\s-1APIC\s0 frames) to the ID3v2 header.
The pictures are supplied to the muxer in form of a video stream with a single
packet. There can be any number of those streams, each will correspond to a
single \s-1APIC\s0 frame.  The stream metadata tags \fItitle\fR and \fIcomment\fR map
to \s-1APIC\s0 \fIdescription\fR and \fIpicture type\fR respectively. See
<\fBhttp://id3.org/id3v2.4.0\-frames\fR> for allowed picture types.
.Sp
Note that the \s-1APIC\s0 frames must be written at the beginning, so the muxer will
buffer the audio frames until it gets all the pictures. It is therefore advised
to provide the pictures as soon as possible to avoid excessive buffering.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A Xing/LAME frame right after the ID3v2 header (if present). It is enabled by
default, but will be written only if the output is seekable. The
\&\f(CW\*(C`write_xing\*(C'\fR private option can be used to disable it.  The frame contains
various information that may be useful to the decoder, like the audio duration
or encoder delay.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A legacy ID3v1 tag at the end of the file (disabled by default). It may be
enabled with the \f(CW\*(C`write_id3v1\*(C'\fR private option, but as its capabilities are
very limited, its usage is not recommended.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
Write an mp3 with an ID3v2.3 header and an ID3v1 footer:
.PP
.Vb 1

specification. Default value is \*(L"2\*(R". See also the
\&\fBsegment_times\fR option.
.Sp
Note that splitting may not be accurate, unless you force the
reference stream key-frames at the given time. See the introductory
notice and the examples below.
.IP "\fBsegment_atclocktime\fR \fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_atclocktime 1|0"
If set to \*(L"1\*(R" split at regular clock time intervals starting from 00:00
o'clock. The \fItime\fR value specified in \fBsegment_time\fR is
used for setting the length of the splitting interval.
.Sp
For example with \fBsegment_time\fR set to \*(L"900\*(R" this makes it possible
to create files at 12:00 o'clock, 12:15, 12:30, etc.
.Sp
Default value is \*(L"0\*(R".
.IP "\fBsegment_time_delta\fR \fIdelta\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_time_delta delta"
Specify the accuracy time when selecting the start time for a
segment, expressed as a duration specification. Default value is \*(L"0\*(R".
.Sp
When delta is specified a key-frame will start a new segment if its
\&\s-1PTS\s0 satisfies the relation:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        PTS >= start_time - time_delta
.Ve
.Sp
This option is useful when splitting video content, which is always
split at \s-1GOP\s0 boundaries, in case a key frame is found just before the
specified split time.
.Sp
In particular may be used in combination with the \fIffmpeg\fR option
\&\fIforce_key_frames\fR. The key frame times specified by
\&\fIforce_key_frames\fR may not be set accurately because of rounding
issues, with the consequence that a key frame time may result set just
before the specified time. For constant frame rate videos a value of
1/(2*\fIframe_rate\fR) should address the worst case mismatch between
the specified time and the time set by \fIforce_key_frames\fR.
.IP "\fBsegment_times\fR \fItimes\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_times times"
Specify a list of split points. \fItimes\fR contains a list of comma
separated duration specifications, in increasing order. See also
the \fBsegment_time\fR option.
.IP "\fBsegment_frames\fR \fIframes\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_frames frames"
Specify a list of split video frame numbers. \fIframes\fR contains a
list of comma separated integer numbers, in increasing order.
.Sp
This option specifies to start a new segment whenever a reference
stream key frame is found and the sequential number (starting from 0)
of the frame is greater or equal to the next value in the list.
.IP "\fBsegment_wrap\fR \fIlimit\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_wrap limit"
Wrap around segment index once it reaches \fIlimit\fR.
.IP "\fBsegment_start_number\fR \fInumber\fR" 4

Set the sequence number of the first segment. Defaults to \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBstrftime\fR \fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "strftime 1|0"
Use the \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR function to define the name of the new
segments to write. If this is selected, the output segment name must
contain a \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR function template. Default value is
\&\f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBreset_timestamps\fR \fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "reset_timestamps 1|0"
Reset timestamps at the begin of each segment, so that each segment
will start with near-zero timestamps. It is meant to ease the playback
of the generated segments. May not work with some combinations of
muxers/codecs. It is set to \f(CW0\fR by default.
.IP "\fBinitial_offset\fR \fIoffset\fR" 4

.Sh "tee"
.IX Subsection "tee"
The tee muxer can be used to write the same data to several files or any
other kind of muxer. It can be used, for example, to both stream a video to
the network and save it to disk at the same time.
.PP
It is different from specifying several outputs to the \fBffmpeg\fR
command-line tool because the audio and video data will be encoded only once
with the tee muxer; encoding can be a very expensive process. It is not
useful when using the libavformat \s-1API\s0 directly because it is then possible
to feed the same packets to several muxers directly.
.PP
The slave outputs are specified in the file name given to the muxer,
separated by '|'. If any of the slave name contains the '|' separator,
leading or trailing spaces or any special character, it must be
escaped (see \fBthe \*(L"Quoting and escaping\*(R"
section in the \f(BIffmpeg\-utils\fB\|(1) manual\fR).
.PP
Muxer options can be specified for each slave by prepending them as a list of
\&\fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs separated by ':', between square brackets. If
the options values contain a special character or the ':' separator, they
must be escaped; note that this is a second level escaping.
.PP
The following special options are also recognized:
.IP "\fBf\fR" 4
.IX Item "f"
Specify the format name. Useful if it cannot be guessed from the
output name suffix.
.IP "\fBbsfs[/\fR\fIspec\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "bsfs[/spec]"
Specify a list of bitstream filters to apply to the specified
output.
.Sp
It is possible to specify to which streams a given bitstream filter
applies, by appending a stream specifier to the option separated by
\&\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR. \fIspec\fR must be a stream specifier (see \fBFormat
stream specifiers\fR).  If the stream specifier is not specified, the
bitstream filters will be applied to all streams in the output.

Several bitstream filters can be specified, separated by \*(L",\*(R".

.SH "METADATA"
.IX Header "METADATA"
FFmpeg is able to dump metadata from media files into a simple UTF\-8\-encoded
INI-like text file and then load it back using the metadata muxer/demuxer.
.PP
The file format is as follows:
.IP "1." 4
A file consists of a header and a number of metadata tags divided into sections,
each on its own line.
.IP "2." 4
The header is a ';FFMETADATA' string, followed by a version number (now 1).
.IP "3." 4
Metadata tags are of the form 'key=value'
.IP "4." 4
Immediately after header follows global metadata
.IP "5." 4
After global metadata there may be sections with per\-stream/per\-chapter
metadata.
.IP "6." 4
A section starts with the section name in uppercase (i.e. \s-1STREAM\s0 or \s-1CHAPTER\s0) in
brackets ('[', ']') and ends with next section or end of file.
.IP "7." 4
At the beginning of a chapter section there may be an optional timebase to be
used for start/end values. It must be in form 'TIMEBASE=num/den', where num and
den are integers. If the timebase is missing then start/end times are assumed to
be in milliseconds.
Next a chapter section must contain chapter start and end times in form
\&'START=num', 'END=num', where num is a positive integer.
.IP "8." 4
Empty lines and lines starting with ';' or '#' are ignored.
.IP "9." 4
Metadata keys or values containing special characters ('=', ';', '#', '\e' and a
newline) must be escaped with a backslash '\e'.
.IP "10." 4
.IX Item "10."
Note that whitespace in metadata (e.g. foo = bar) is considered to be a part of
the tag (in the example above key is 'foo ', value is ' bar').
.PP
A ffmetadata file might look like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        ;FFMETADATA1
\&        title=bike\e\eshed
\&        ;this is a comment

\&        title=chapter \e#1
\&        [STREAM]
\&        title=multi\e
\&        line
.Ve
.PP
By using the ffmetadata muxer and demuxer it is possible to extract
metadata from an input file to an ffmetadata file, and then transcode
the file into an output file with the edited ffmetadata file.

\&        file:<filename>
.Ve
.PP
where \fIfilename\fR is the path of the file to read.

If enabled, try to verify the peer that we are communicating with.
Note, if using OpenSSL, this currently only makes sure that the
peer certificate is signed by one of the root certificates in the \s-1CA\s0
database, but it does not validate that the certificate actually
matches the host name we are trying to connect to. (With GnuTLS,
the host name is validated as well.)

Specify the filtergraph to use as input. Each video open output must be
labelled by a unique string of the form "out\fIN\fR", where \fIN\fR is a
number starting from 0 corresponding to the mapped input stream
generated by the device.
The first unlabelled output is automatically assigned to the \*(L"out0\*(R"
label, but all the others need to be specified explicitly.
.Sp
The suffix \*(L"+subcc\*(R" can be appended to the output label to create an extra
stream with the closed captions packets attached to that output
(experimental; only for \s-1EIA\-608\s0 / \s-1CEA\-708\s0 for now).
The subcc streams are created after all the normal streams, in the order of
the corresponding stream.
For example, if there is \*(L"out19+subcc\*(R", \*(L"out7+subcc\*(R" and up to \*(L"out42\*(R", the

\&\f(CW\*(C`\-use_libv4l2\*(C'\fR input device option.
.PP
The name of the device to grab is a file device node, usually Linux
systems tend to automatically create such nodes when the device
(e.g. an \s-1USB\s0 webcam) is plugged into the system, and has a name of the
kind \fI/dev/video\fIN\fI\fR, where \fIN\fR is a number associated to
the device.
.PP
Video4Linux2 devices usually support a limited set of
\&\fIwidth\fRx\fIheight\fR sizes and frame rates. You can check which are
supported using \fB\-list_formats all\fR for Video4Linux2 devices.
Some devices, like \s-1TV\s0 cards, support one or more standards. It is possible
to list all the supported standards using \fB\-list_standards all\fR.
.PP
The time base for the timestamps is 1 microsecond. Depending on the kernel
version and configuration, the timestamps may be derived from the real time
clock (origin at the Unix Epoch) or the monotonic clock (origin usually at
boot time, unaffected by \s-1NTP\s0 or manual changes to the clock). The
\&\fB\-timestamps abs\fR or \fB\-ts abs\fR option can be used to force
conversion into the real time clock.

.PP
This device allows one to capture a region of an X11 display.
.PP
The filename passed as input has the syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        [<hostname>]:<display_number>.<screen_number>[+<x_offset>,<y_offset>]
.Ve
.PP
\&\fIhostname\fR:\fIdisplay_number\fR.\fIscreen_number\fR specifies the
X11 display name of the screen to grab from. \fIhostname\fR can be
omitted, and defaults to \*(L"localhost\*(R". The environment variable
\&\fB\s-1DISPLAY\s0\fR contains the default display name.
.PP
\&\fIx_offset\fR and \fIy_offset\fR specify the offsets of the grabbed
area with respect to the top-left border of the X11 screen. They
default to 0.
.PP
Check the X11 documentation (e.g. \fBman X\fR) for more detailed

.IX Item "buffer_duration"
.PD
Control the size and duration of the PulseAudio buffer. A small buffer
gives more control, but requires more frequent updates.
.Sp
\&\fBbuffer_size\fR specifies size in bytes while
\&\fBbuffer_duration\fR specifies duration in milliseconds.
.Sp
When both options are provided then the highest value is used
(duration is recalculated to bytes using stream parameters). If they
are set to 0 (which is default), the device will use the default
PulseAudio duration value. By default PulseAudio set buffer duration
to around 2 seconds.
.IP "\fBprebuf\fR" 4
.IX Item "prebuf"
Specify pre-buffering size in bytes. The server does not start with
playback before at least \fBprebuf\fR bytes are available in the
buffer. By default this option is initialized to the same value as
\&\fBbuffer_size\fR or \fBbuffer_duration\fR (whichever is bigger).
.IP "\fBminreq\fR" 4
.IX Item "minreq"
Specify minimum request size in bytes. The server does not request less
than \fBminreq\fR bytes from the client, instead waits until the buffer
is free enough to request more bytes at once. It is recommended to not set
this option, which will initialize this to a value that is deemed sensible
by the server.

.SH "FILTERING INTRODUCTION"
.IX Header "FILTERING INTRODUCTION"
Filtering in FFmpeg is enabled through the libavfilter library.
.PP
In libavfilter, a filter can have multiple inputs and multiple
outputs.
To illustrate the sorts of things that are possible, we consider the
following filtergraph.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&                        [main]
\&        input --> split ---------------------> overlay --> output
\&                    |                             ^
\&                    |[tmp]                  [flip]|
\&                    +-----> crop --> vflip -------+
.Ve
.PP
This filtergraph splits the input stream in two streams, then sends one
stream through the crop filter and the vflip filter, before merging it
back with the other stream by overlaying it on top. You can use the
following command to achieve this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] crop=iw:ih/2:0:0, vflip [flip]; [main][flip] overlay=0:H/2" OUTPUT
.Ve
.PP
The result will be that the top half of the video is mirrored
onto the bottom half of the output video.
.PP
Filters in the same linear chain are separated by commas, and distinct
linear chains of filters are separated by semicolons. In our example,
\&\fIcrop,vflip\fR are in one linear chain, \fIsplit\fR and
\&\fIoverlay\fR are separately in another. The points where the linear
chains join are labelled by names enclosed in square brackets. In the
example, the split filter generates two outputs that are associated to
the labels \fI[main]\fR and \fI[tmp]\fR.
.PP
The stream sent to the second output of \fIsplit\fR, labelled as
\&\fI[tmp]\fR, is processed through the \fIcrop\fR filter, which crops
away the lower half part of the video, and then vertically flipped. The
\&\fIoverlay\fR filter takes in input the first unchanged output of the
split filter (which was labelled as \fI[main]\fR), and overlay on its
lower half the output generated by the \fIcrop,vflip\fR filterchain.
.PP
Some filters take in input a list of parameters: they are specified
after the filter name and an equal sign, and are separated from each other
by a colon.
.PP
There exist so-called \fIsource filters\fR that do not have an
audio/video input, and \fIsink filters\fR that will not have audio/video
output.
.SH "GRAPH"
.IX Header "GRAPH"

to see how to use \fIgraph2dot\fR.
.PP
You can then pass the dot description to the \fIdot\fR program (from
the graphviz suite of programs) and obtain a graphical representation
of the filtergraph.

\&        dot -Tpng graph.tmp -o graph.png && \e
\&        display graph.png
.Ve
.PP
can be used to create and display an image representing the graph
described by the \fI\s-1GRAPH_DESCRIPTION\s0\fR string. Note that this string must be
a complete self-contained graph, with its inputs and outputs explicitly defined.
For example if your command line is of the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg -i infile -vf scale=640:360 outfile
.Ve
.PP
your \fI\s-1GRAPH_DESCRIPTION\s0\fR string will need to be of the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink
.Ve
.PP
you may also need to set the \fInullsrc\fR parameters and add a \fIformat\fR
filter in order to simulate a specific input file.
.SH "FILTERGRAPH DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "FILTERGRAPH DESCRIPTION"
A filtergraph is a directed graph of connected filters. It can contain
cycles, and there can be multiple links between a pair of
filters. Each link has one input pad on one side connecting it to one
filter from which it takes its input, and one output pad on the other
side connecting it to one filter accepting its output.
.PP
Each filter in a filtergraph is an instance of a filter class
registered in the application, which defines the features and the
number of input and output pads of the filter.
.PP
A filter with no input pads is called a \*(L"source\*(R", and a filter with no
output pads is called a \*(L"sink\*(R".

\&\fB\-filter\fR/\fB\-vf\fR/\fB\-af\fR and
\&\fB\-filter_complex\fR options in \fBffmpeg\fR and
\&\fB\-vf\fR/\fB\-af\fR in \fBffplay\fR, and by the
\&\f(CW\*(C`avfilter_graph_parse_ptr()\*(C'\fR function defined in
\&\fIlibavfilter/avfilter.h\fR.
.PP
A filterchain consists of a sequence of connected filters, each one
connected to the previous one in the sequence. A filterchain is
represented by a list of \*(L",\*(R"\-separated filter descriptions.
.PP
A filtergraph consists of a sequence of filterchains. A sequence of
filterchains is represented by a list of \*(L";\*(R"\-separated filterchain
descriptions.
.PP
A filter is represented by a string of the form:
[\fIin_link_1\fR]...[\fIin_link_N\fR]\fIfilter_name\fR=\fIarguments\fR[\fIout_link_1\fR]...[\fIout_link_M\fR]
.PP
\&\fIfilter_name\fR is the name of the filter class of which the
described filter is an instance of, and has to be the name of one of
the filter classes registered in the program.
The name of the filter class is optionally followed by a string
"=\fIarguments\fR".
.PP
\&\fIarguments\fR is a string which contains the parameters used to
initialize the filter instance. It may have one of two forms:
.IP "\(bu" 4
A ':'\-separated list of \fIkey=value\fR pairs.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A ':'\-separated list of \fIvalue\fR. In this case, the keys are assumed to be
the option names in the order they are declared. E.g. the \f(CW\*(C`fade\*(C'\fR filter
declares three options in this order \*(-- \fBtype\fR, \fBstart_frame\fR and
\&\fBnb_frames\fR. Then the parameter list \fIin:0:30\fR means that the value
\&\fIin\fR is assigned to the option \fBtype\fR, \fI0\fR to
\&\fBstart_frame\fR and \fI30\fR to \fBnb_frames\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A ':'\-separated list of mixed direct \fIvalue\fR and long \fIkey=value\fR
pairs. The direct \fIvalue\fR must precede the \fIkey=value\fR pairs, and
follow the same constraints order of the previous point. The following
\&\fIkey=value\fR pairs can be set in any preferred order.
.PP
If the option value itself is a list of items (e.g. the \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR filter
takes a list of pixel formats), the items in the list are usually separated by
\&'|'.
.PP
The list of arguments can be quoted using the character \*(L"'\*(R" as initial
and ending mark, and the character '\e' for escaping the characters
within the quoted text; otherwise the argument string is considered
terminated when the next special character (belonging to the set
\&\*(L"[]=;,\*(R") is encountered.
.PP
The name and arguments of the filter are optionally preceded and
followed by a list of link labels.
A link label allows one to name a link and associate it to a filter output
or input pad. The preceding labels \fIin_link_1\fR
\&... \fIin_link_N\fR, are associated to the filter input pads,
the following labels \fIout_link_1\fR ... \fIout_link_M\fR, are
associated to the output pads.
.PP
When two link labels with the same name are found in the
filtergraph, a link between the corresponding input and output pad is
created.
.PP
If an output pad is not labelled, it is linked by default to the first
unlabelled input pad of the next filter in the filterchain.
For example in the filterchain
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        nullsrc, split[L1], [L2]overlay, nullsink
.Ve
.PP
the split filter instance has two output pads, and the overlay filter
instance two input pads. The first output pad of split is labelled
\&\*(L"L1\*(R", the first input pad of overlay is labelled \*(L"L2\*(R", and the second
output pad of split is linked to the second input pad of overlay,
which are both unlabelled.
.PP
In a filter description, if the input label of the first filter is not
specified, \*(L"in\*(R" is assumed; if the output label of the last filter is not
specified, \*(L"out\*(R" is assumed.
.PP
In a complete filterchain all the unlabelled filter input and output
pads must be connected. A filtergraph is considered valid if all the
filter input and output pads of all the filterchains are connected.
.PP
Libavfilter will automatically insert \fBscale\fR filters where format
conversion is required. It is possible to specify swscale flags
for those automatically inserted scalers by prepending
\&\f(CW\*(C`sws_flags=\f(CIflags\f(CW;\*(C'\fR
to the filtergraph description.
.PP
Here is a \s-1BNF\s0 description of the filtergraph syntax:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        <NAME>             ::= sequence of alphanumeric characters and '_'
\&        <LINKLABEL>        ::= "[" <NAME> "]"
\&        <LINKLABELS>       ::= <LINKLABEL> [<LINKLABELS>]
\&        <FILTER_ARGUMENTS> ::= sequence of chars (possibly quoted)
\&        <FILTER>           ::= [<LINKLABELS>] <NAME> ["=" <FILTER_ARGUMENTS>] [<LINKLABELS>]
\&        <FILTERCHAIN>      ::= <FILTER> [,<FILTERCHAIN>]
\&        <FILTERGRAPH>      ::= [sws_flags=<flags>;] <FILTERCHAIN> [;<FILTERGRAPH>]
.Ve
.Sh "Notes on filtergraph escaping"
.IX Subsection "Notes on filtergraph escaping"
Filtergraph description composition entails several levels of
escaping. See \fBthe \*(L"Quoting and escaping\*(R"
section in the \f(BIffmpeg\-utils\fB\|(1) manual\fR for more
information about the employed escaping procedure.
.PP
A first level escaping affects the content of each filter option
value, which may contain the special character \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR used to
separate values, or one of the escaping characters \f(CW\*(C`\e'\*(C'\fR.
.PP
A second level escaping affects the whole filter description, which
may contain the escaping characters \f(CW\*(C`\e'\*(C'\fR or the special
characters \f(CW\*(C`[],;\*(C'\fR used by the filtergraph description.
.PP
Finally, when you specify a filtergraph on a shell commandline, you
need to perform a third level escaping for the shell special
characters contained within it.
.PP
For example, consider the following string to be embedded in
the \fBdrawtext\fR filter description \fBtext\fR value:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        this is a 'string': may contain one, or more, special characters
.Ve
.PP
This string contains the \f(CW\*(C`'\*(C'\fR special escaping character, and the
\&\f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR special character, so it needs to be escaped in this way:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        text=this is a \e'string\e'\e: may contain one, or more, special characters
.Ve
.PP
A second level of escaping is required when embedding the filter
description in a filtergraph description, in order to escape all the
filtergraph special characters. Thus the example above becomes:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        drawtext=text=this is a \e\e\e'string\e\e\e'\e\e: may contain one\e, or more\e, special characters
.Ve
.PP
(note that in addition to the \f(CW\*(C`\e'\*(C'\fR escaping special characters,
also \f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR needs to be escaped).
.PP
Finally an additional level of escaping is needed when writing the
filtergraph description in a shell command, which depends on the
escaping rules of the adopted shell. For example, assuming that
\&\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR is special and needs to be escaped with another \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR, the
previous string will finally result in:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        -vf "drawtext=text=this is a \e\e\e\e\e\e'string\e\e\e\e\e\e'\e\e\e\e: may contain one\e\e, or more\e\e, special characters"
.Ve
.SH "TIMELINE EDITING"
.IX Header "TIMELINE EDITING"
Some filters support a generic \fBenable\fR option. For the filters
supporting timeline editing, this option can be set to an expression which is
evaluated before sending a frame to the filter. If the evaluation is non\-zero,
the filter will be enabled, otherwise the frame will be sent unchanged to the
next filter in the filtergraph.
.PP
The expression accepts the following values:
.IP "\fBt\fR" 4
.IX Item "t"
timestamp expressed in seconds, \s-1NAN\s0 if the input timestamp is unknown
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0
.IP "\fBpos\fR" 4
.IX Item "pos"
the position in the file of the input frame, \s-1NAN\s0 if unknown
.IP "\fBw\fR" 4
.IX Item "w"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBh\fR" 4
.IX Item "h"
.PD
width and height of the input frame if video
.PP
Additionally, these filters support an \fBenable\fR command that can be used
to re-define the expression.
.PP
Like any other filtering option, the \fBenable\fR option follows the same
rules.
.PP
For example, to enable a blur filter (\fBsmartblur\fR) from 10 seconds to 3
minutes, and a \fBcurves\fR filter starting at 3 seconds:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        smartblur = enable='between(t,10,3*60)',
\&        curves    = enable='gte(t,3)' : preset=cross_process
.Ve
.SH "AUDIO FILTERS"
.IX Header "AUDIO FILTERS"
When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
existing filters using \f(CW\*(C`\-\-disable\-filters\*(C'\fR.
The configure output will show the audio filters included in your
build.
.PP
Below is a description of the currently available audio filters.
.Sh "adelay"
.IX Subsection "adelay"
Delay one or more audio channels.
.PP
Samples in delayed channel are filled with silence.
.PP
The filter accepts the following option:
.IP "\fBdelays\fR" 4
.IX Item "delays"
Set list of delays in milliseconds for each channel separated by '|'.
At least one delay greater than 0 should be provided.
Unused delays will be silently ignored. If number of given delays is
smaller than number of channels all remaining channels will not be delayed.
.PP
\fIExamples\fR
.IX Subsection "Examples"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Delay first channel by 1.5 seconds, the third channel by 0.5 seconds and leave
the second channel (and any other channels that may be present) unchanged.

.Vb 1
\&        adelay=1500|0|500
.Ve
.Sh "aecho"
.IX Subsection "aecho"
Apply echoing to the input audio.
.PP
Echoes are reflected sound and can occur naturally amongst mountains
(and sometimes large buildings) when talking or shouting; digital echo
effects emulate this behaviour and are often used to help fill out the
sound of a single instrument or vocal. The time difference between the
original signal and the reflection is the \f(CW\*(C`delay\*(C'\fR, and the
loudness of the reflected signal is the \f(CW\*(C`decay\*(C'\fR.
Multiple echoes can have different delays and decays.
.PP
A description of the accepted parameters follows.
.IP "\fBin_gain\fR" 4
.IX Item "in_gain"
Set input gain of reflected signal. Default is \f(CW0.6\fR.
.IP "\fBout_gain\fR" 4
.IX Item "out_gain"

.IP "\fBdelays\fR" 4
.IX Item "delays"
Set list of time intervals in milliseconds between original signal and reflections
separated by '|'. Allowed range for each \f(CW\*(C`delay\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`(0 \- 90000.0]\*(C'\fR.
Default is \f(CW1000\fR.
.IP "\fBdecays\fR" 4
.IX Item "decays"
Set list of loudnesses of reflected signals separated by '|'.
Allowed range for each \f(CW\*(C`decay\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`(0 \- 1.0]\*(C'\fR.
Default is \f(CW0.5\fR.

Each expression in \fIexprs\fR can contain the following constants and functions:
.IP "\fBch\fR" 4
.IX Item "ch"
channel number of the current expression
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"

.IX Subsection "amerge"
Merge two or more audio streams into a single multi-channel stream.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBinputs\fR" 4
.IX Item "inputs"
Set the number of inputs. Default is 2.
.PP
If the channel layouts of the inputs are disjoint, and therefore compatible,
the channel layout of the output will be set accordingly and the channels
will be reordered as necessary. If the channel layouts of the inputs are not
disjoint, the output will have all the channels of the first input then all
the channels of the second input, in that order, and the channel layout of
the output will be the default value corresponding to the total number of
channels.
.PP
For example, if the first input is in 2.1 (\s-1FL+FR+LF\s0) and the second input
is \s-1FC+BL+BR\s0, then the output will be in 5.1, with the channels in the
following order: a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel of the
first input, b1 is the first channel of the second input).
.PP
On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output channels will be
in the default order: a1, a2, b1, b2, and the channel layout will be
arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may or may not be the expected value.

All inputs must have the same sample rate, and format.

Enable stretching/squeezing the data to make it match the timestamps. Disabled
by default. When disabled, time gaps are covered with silence.
.IP "\fBmin_delta\fR" 4
.IX Item "min_delta"

.IP "\fBmax_comp\fR" 4
.IX Item "max_comp"
The maximum compensation in samples per second. Only relevant with compensate=1.
The default value is 500.
.IP "\fBfirst_pts\fR" 4
.IX Item "first_pts"
Assume that the first \s-1PTS\s0 should be this value. The time base is 1 / sample
rate. This allows for padding/trimming at the start of the stream. By default,
no assumption is made about the first frame's expected \s-1PTS\s0, so no padding or
trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with
silence if an audio stream starts after the video stream or to trim any samples
with a negative \s-1PTS\s0 due to encoder delay.

Timestamp (in seconds) of the start of the section to keep. I.e. the audio
sample with the timestamp \fIstart\fR will be the first sample in the output.
.IP "\fBend\fR" 4
.IX Item "end"
Specify time of the first audio sample that will be dropped, i.e. the
audio sample immediately preceding the one with the timestamp \fIend\fR will be
the last sample in the output.
.IP "\fBstart_pts\fR" 4
.IX Item "start_pts"

instead of seconds.
.IP "\fBend_pts\fR" 4
.IX Item "end_pts"

of seconds.
.IP "\fBduration\fR" 4
.IX Item "duration"

.IP "\fBstart_sample\fR" 4
.IX Item "start_sample"
The number of the first sample that should be output.
.IP "\fBend_sample\fR" 4
.IX Item "end_sample"
The number of the first sample that should be dropped.
.PP
\&\fBstart\fR, \fBend\fR, and \fBduration\fR are expressed as time
duration specifications; see
\&\fBthe Time duration section in the \f(BIffmpeg\-utils\fB\|(1) manual\fR.
.PP
Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the \fBduration\fR
option look at the frame timestamp, while the _sample options simply count the
samples that pass through the filter. So start/end_pts and start/end_sample will
give different results when the timestamps are wrong, inexact or do not start at
zero. Also note that this filter does not modify the timestamps. If you wish
to have the output timestamps start at zero, insert the asetpts filter after the
atrim filter.
.PP
If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all samples that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple atrim
filters.
.PP
The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.
.PP
Examples:
.IP "\(bu" 4

.PD
A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level
of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume. \fIattacks\fR refers to
increase of volume and \fIdecays\fR refers to decrease of volume. For most
situations, the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be
shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden
loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and
a typical value for decay is 0.8 seconds.
.IP "\fBpoints\fR" 4
.IX Item "points"
A list of points for the transfer function, specified in dB relative to the

Set an initial volume, in dB, to be assumed for each channel when filtering
starts. This permits the user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for
example, a very large gain is not applied to initial signal levels before the
companding has begun to operate. A typical value for audio which is initially
quiet is \-90 dB. It defaults to 0.
.IP "\fBdelay\fR" 4
.IX Item "delay"
Set a delay, in seconds. The input audio is analyzed immediately, but audio is
delayed before being fed to the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay
approximately equal to the attack/decay times allows the filter to effectively
operate in predictive rather than reactive mode. It defaults to 0.

.IX Item "*<gain coefficients are zeroes or ones,>"
.PD 0
.IP "*<only one input per channel output,>" 4
.IX Item "*<only one input per channel output,>"
.PD
.PP
If all these conditions are satisfied, the filter will notify the user (\*(L"Pure
channel mapping detected\*(R"), and use an optimized and lossless method to do the
remapping.
.PP
For example, if you have a 5.1 source and want a stereo audio stream by
dropping the extra channels:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        pan="stereo| c0=FL | c1=FR"
.Ve
.PP
Given the same source, you can also switch front left and front right channels
and keep the input channel layout:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        pan="5.1| c0=c1 | c1=c0 | c2=c2 | c3=c3 | c4=c4 | c5=c5"
.Ve
.PP
If the input is a stereo audio stream, you can mute the front left channel (and
still keep the stereo channel layout) with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        pan="stereo|c1=c1"
.Ve
.PP
Still with a stereo audio stream input, you can copy the right channel in both

Remove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the audio.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBstart_periods\fR" 4
.IX Item "start_periods"
This value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of
the audio. A value of zero indicates no silence should be trimmed from the
beginning. When specifying a non-zero value, it trims audio up until it
finds non\-silence. Normally, when trimming silence from beginning of audio
the \fIstart_periods\fR will be \f(CW1\fR but it can be increased to higher
values to trim all audio up to specific count of non-silence periods.
Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBstart_duration\fR" 4
.IX Item "start_duration"
Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops
trimming audio. By increasing the duration, bursts of noises can be treated
as silence and trimmed off. Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBstart_threshold\fR" 4
.IX Item "start_threshold"
This indicates what sample value should be treated as silence. For digital
audio, a value of \f(CW0\fR may be fine but for audio recorded from analog,
you may wish to increase the value to account for background noise.
Can be specified in dB (in case \*(L"dB\*(R" is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBstop_periods\fR" 4
.IX Item "stop_periods"
Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio.
To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a \fIstop_periods\fR
that is negative. This value is then treated as a positive value and is
used to indicate the effect should restart processing as specified by
\&\fIstart_periods\fR, making it suitable for removing periods of silence
in the middle of the audio.
Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBstop_duration\fR" 4
.IX Item "stop_duration"
Specify a duration of silence that must exist before audio is not copied any
more. By specifying a higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in
the audio.
Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBstop_threshold\fR" 4
.IX Item "stop_threshold"
This is the same as \fBstart_threshold\fR but for trimming silence from
the end of audio.
Can be specified in dB (in case \*(L"dB\*(R" is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBleave_silence\fR" 4
.IX Item "leave_silence"
This indicate that \fIstop_duration\fR length of audio should be left intact

Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the end of filter chain.
.PP
This sink is mainly intended for programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in \fIlibavfilter/buffersink.h\fR
or the options system.
.PP
It accepts a pointer to an AVABufferSinkContext structure, which
defines the incoming buffers' formats, to be passed as the opaque
parameter to \f(CW\*(C`avfilter_init_filter\*(C'\fR for initialization.
.Sh "anullsink"
.IX Subsection "anullsink"
Null audio sink; do absolutely nothing with the input audio. It is
mainly useful as a template and for use in analysis / debugging
tools.
.SH "VIDEO FILTERS"
.IX Header "VIDEO FILTERS"
When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
existing filters using \f(CW\*(C`\-\-disable\-filters\*(C'\fR.
The configure output will show the video filters included in your
build.
.PP
Below is a description of the currently available video filters.
.Sh "alphaextract"
.IX Subsection "alphaextract"
Extract the alpha component from the input as a grayscale video. This
is especially useful with the \fIalphamerge\fR filter.
.Sh "alphamerge"
.IX Subsection "alphamerge"
Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the
grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for use with
\&\fIalphaextract\fR to allow the transmission or storage of frame
sequences that have alpha in a format that doesn't support an alpha
channel.
.PP
For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal YUV-encoded video
and a separate video created with \fIalphaextract\fR, you might use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        movie=in_alpha.mkv [alpha]; [in][alpha] alphamerge [out]
.Ve
.PP
Since this filter is designed for reconstruction, it operates on frame
sequences without considering timestamps, and terminates when either
input reaches end of stream. This will cause problems if your encoding
pipeline drops frames. If you're trying to apply an image as an
overlay to a video stream, consider the \fIoverlay\fR filter instead.
.Sh "ass"
.IX Subsection "ass"
Same as the \fBsubtitles\fR filter, except that it doesn't require libavcodec
and libavformat to work. On the other hand, it is limited to \s-1ASS\s0 (Advanced
Substation Alpha) subtitles files.
.PP
This filter accepts the following option in addition to the common options from
the \fBsubtitles\fR filter:

Compute the bounding box for the non-black pixels in the input frame
luminance plane.
.PP
This filter computes the bounding box containing all the pixels with a
luminance value greater than the minimum allowed value.
The parameters describing the bounding box are printed on the filter
log.
.PP
The filter accepts the following option:
.IP "\fBmin_val\fR" 4
.IX Item "min_val"
Set the minimal luminance value. Default is \f(CW16\fR.
.Sh "blackdetect"
.IX Subsection "blackdetect"
Detect video intervals that are (almost) completely black. Can be
useful to detect chapter transitions, commercials, or invalid
recordings. Output lines contains the time for the start, end and
duration of the detected black interval expressed in seconds.
.PP
In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at
least to the \s-1AV_LOG_INFO\s0 value.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBblack_min_duration, d\fR" 4
.IX Item "black_min_duration, d"

be a non-negative floating point number.
.Sp
Default value is 2.0.
.IP "\fBpicture_black_ratio_th, pic_th\fR" 4

for which a picture is considered black.
Default value is 0.98.
.IP "\fBpixel_black_th, pix_th\fR" 4
.IX Item "pixel_black_th, pix_th"
Set the threshold for considering a pixel \*(L"black\*(R".
.Sp
The threshold expresses the maximum pixel luminance value for which a
pixel is considered \*(L"black\*(R". The provided value is scaled according to
the following equation:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        <absolute_threshold> = <luminance_minimum_value> + <pixel_black_th> * <luminance_range_size>
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fIluminance_range_size\fR and \fIluminance_minimum_value\fR depend on
the input video format, the range is [0\-255] for \s-1YUV\s0 full-range
formats and [16\-235] for \s-1YUV\s0 non full-range formats.
.Sp
Default value is 0.10.
.PP
The following example sets the maximum pixel threshold to the minimum
value, and detects only black intervals of 2 or more seconds:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        blackdetect=d=2:pix_th=0.00
.Ve
.Sh "blackframe"
.IX Subsection "blackframe"
Detect frames that are (almost) completely black. Can be useful to
detect chapter transitions or commercials. Output lines consist of
the frame number of the detected frame, the percentage of blackness,
the position in the file if known or \-1 and the timestamp in seconds.
.PP
In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at
least to the \s-1AV_LOG_INFO\s0 value.
.PP

.PP
It accepts the following parameters:
.IP "\fBlimit\fR" 4
.IX Item "limit"
Set higher black value threshold, which can be optionally specified
from nothing (0) to everything (255 for 8bit based formats). An intensity
value greater to the set value is considered non\-black. It defaults to 24.
You can also specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which will be scaled depending
on the bitdepth of the pixel format.
.IP "\fBround\fR" 4
.IX Item "round"
The value which the width/height should be divisible by. It defaults to
16. The offset is automatically adjusted to center the video. Use 2 to

encoding to most video codecs.
.IP "\fBreset_count, reset\fR" 4

Set the counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will
reset the previously detected largest video area and start over to
detect the current optimal crop area. Default value is 0.
.Sp
This can be useful when channel logos distort the video area. 0
indicates 'never reset', and returns the largest area encountered during
playback.
.Sh "curves"
.IX Subsection "curves"
Apply color adjustments using curves.
.PP
This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop and \s-1GIMP\s0 curves tools. Each
component (red, green and blue) has its values defined by \fIN\fR key points
tied from each other using a smooth curve. The x\-axis represents the pixel
values from the input frame, and the y\-axis the new pixel values to be set for
the output frame.
.PP
By default, a component curve is defined by the two points \fI(0;0)\fR and
\&\fI(1;1)\fR. This creates a straight line where each original pixel value is
\&\*(L"adjusted\*(R" to its own value, which means no change to the image.
.PP
The filter allows you to redefine these two points and add some more. A new
curve (using a natural cubic spline interpolation) will be define to pass
smoothly through all these new coordinates. The new defined points needs to be
strictly increasing over the x\-axis, and their \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR values must
be in the \fI[0;1]\fR interval.  If the computed curves happened to go outside
the vector spaces, the values will be clipped accordingly.
.PP
If there is no key point defined in \f(CW\*(C`x=0\*(C'\fR, the filter will automatically
insert a \fI(0;0)\fR point. In the same way, if there is no key point defined
in \f(CW\*(C`x=1\*(C'\fR, the filter will automatically insert a \fI(1;1)\fR point.

Denoise frames using 2D \s-1DCT\s0 (frequency domain filtering).
.PP
This filter is not designed for real time.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBsigma, s\fR" 4
.IX Item "sigma, s"
Set the noise sigma constant.
.Sp
This \fIsigma\fR defines a hard threshold of \f(CW\*(C`3 * sigma\*(C'\fR; every \s-1DCT\s0
coefficient (absolute value) below this threshold with be dropped.
.Sp
If you need a more advanced filtering, see \fBexpr\fR.
.Sp
Default is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBoverlap\fR" 4
.IX Item "overlap"
Set number overlapping pixels for each block. Since the filter can be slow, you
may want to reduce this value, at the cost of a less effective filter and the
risk of various artefacts.
.Sp
If the overlapping value doesn't allow to process the whole input width or
height, a warning will be displayed and according borders won't be denoised.
.Sp
Default value is \fIblocksize\fR\-1, which is the best possible setting.
.IP "\fBexpr, e\fR" 4
.IX Item "expr, e"
Set the coefficient factor expression.
.Sp
For each coefficient of a \s-1DCT\s0 block, this expression will be evaluated as a
multiplier value for the coefficient.
.Sp
If this is option is set, the \fBsigma\fR option will be ignored.
.Sp
The absolute value of the coefficient can be accessed through the \fIc\fR
variable.
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4

.Sp
The default value is \fI3\fR (8x8) and can be raised to \fI4\fR for a

.IX Item "max_glyph_a, ascent"
the maximum distance from the baseline to the highest/upper grid
coordinate used to place a glyph outline point, for all the rendered
glyphs.
It is a positive value, due to the grid's orientation with the Y axis

These parameters allow the \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR expressions to refer
each other, so you can for example specify \f(CW\*(C`y=x/dar\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fIText expansion\fR
.IX Subsection "Text expansion"
.PP
If \fBexpansion\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR,
the filter recognizes \fIstrftime()\fR sequences in the provided text and
expands them accordingly. Check the documentation of \fIstrftime()\fR. This
feature is deprecated.
.PP
If \fBexpansion\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, the text is printed verbatim.
.PP
If \fBexpansion\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`normal\*(C'\fR (which is the default),
the following expansion mechanism is used.
.PP
The backslash character '\e', followed by any character, always expands to
the second character.
.PP
Sequence of the form \f(CW\*(C`%{...}\*(C'\fR are expanded. The text between the
braces is a function name, possibly followed by arguments separated by ':'.
If the arguments contain special characters or delimiters (':' or '}'),
they should be escaped.
.PP
Note that they probably must also be escaped as the value for the
\&\fBtext\fR option in the filter argument string and as the filter
argument in the filtergraph description, and possibly also for the shell,
that makes up to four levels of escaping; using a text file avoids these
problems.
.PP
The following functions are available:
.IP "\fBexpr, e\fR" 4
.IX Item "expr, e"
The expression evaluation result.
.Sp
It must take one argument specifying the expression to be evaluated,
which accepts the same constants and functions as the \fIx\fR and
\&\fIy\fR values. Note that not all constants should be used, for
example the text size is not known when evaluating the expression, so
the constants \fItext_w\fR and \fItext_h\fR will have an undefined
value.
.IP "\fBexpr_int_format, eif\fR" 4
.IX Item "expr_int_format, eif"
Evaluate the expression's value and output as formatted integer.
.Sp
The first argument is the expression to be evaluated, just as for the \fIexpr\fR function.
The second argument specifies the output format. Allowed values are 'x', 'X', 'd' and
\&'u'. They are treated exactly as in the printf function.
The third parameter is optional and sets the number of positions taken by the output.
It can be used to add padding with zeros from the left.
.IP "\fBgmtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "gmtime"
The time at which the filter is running, expressed in \s-1UTC\s0.
It can accept an argument: a \fIstrftime()\fR format string.
.IP "\fBlocaltime\fR" 4
.IX Item "localtime"
The time at which the filter is running, expressed in the local time zone.
It can accept an argument: a \fIstrftime()\fR format string.
.IP "\fBmetadata\fR" 4
.IX Item "metadata"
Frame metadata. It must take one argument specifying metadata key.
.IP "\fBn, frame_num\fR" 4
.IX Item "n, frame_num"
The frame number, starting from 0.
.IP "\fBpict_type\fR" 4
.IX Item "pict_type"
A 1 character description of the current picture type.
.IP "\fBpts\fR" 4
.IX Item "pts"
The timestamp of the current frame.
It can take up to two arguments.
.Sp
The first argument is the format of the timestamp; it defaults to \f(CW\*(C`flt\*(C'\fR
for seconds as a decimal number with microsecond accuracy; \f(CW\*(C`hms\*(C'\fR stands
for a formatted \fI[\-]HH:MM:SS.mmm\fR timestamp with millisecond accuracy.

\&\f(CW\*(C`bottom\*(C'\fR).
.Sh "fieldmatch"
.IX Subsection "fieldmatch"
Field matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the
progressive frames from a telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated
frames, so to achieve a complete inverse telecine \f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR needs to be
followed by a decimation filter such as \fBdecimate\fR in the filtergraph.
.PP
The separation of the field matching and the decimation is notably motivated by
the possibility of inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two.
If the source has mixed telecined and real interlaced content,
\&\f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts.
But these remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be
de-interlaced by a later filter such as \fByadif\fR before decimation.
.PP
In addition to the various configuration options, \f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR can take an
optional second stream, activated through the \fBppsrc\fR option. If
enabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from
this second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed in order to
help the various algorithms of the filter, while keeping the output lossless
(assuming the fields are matched properly). Typically, a field-aware denoiser,
or brightness/contrast adjustments can help.
.PP
Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as \s-1TIVTC/TFM\s0 (AviSynth project)
and \s-1VIVTC/VFM\s0 (VapourSynth project). The later is a light clone of \s-1TFM\s0 from
which \f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR is based on. While the semantic and usage are very
close, some behaviour and options names can differ.
.PP
The \fBdecimate\fR filter currently only works for constant frame rate input.
Do not use \f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR and \fBdecimate\fR if your input has mixed
telecined and progressive content with changing framerate.

Set the matching mode or strategy to use. \fBpc\fR mode is the safest in the
sense that it won't risk creating jerkiness due to duplicate frames when
possible, but if there are bad edits or blended fields it will end up
outputting combed frames when a good match might actually exist. On the other
hand, \fBpcn_ub\fR mode is the most risky in terms of creating jerkiness,
but will almost always find a good frame if there is one. The other values are
all somewhere in between \fBpc\fR and \fBpcn_ub\fR in terms of risking
jerkiness and creating duplicate frames versus finding good matches in sections
with bad edits, orphaned fields, blended fields, etc.

This is the area combing threshold used for combed frame detection. This
essentially controls how \*(L"strong\*(R" or \*(L"visible\*(R" combing must be to be detected.
Larger values mean combing must be more visible and smaller values mean combing
can be less visible or strong and still be detected. Valid settings are from
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR (every pixel will be detected as combed) to \f(CW255\fR (no pixel will
be detected as combed). This is basically a pixel difference value. A good

The numbers correspond to the progressive frame the fields relate to. Here, the
first two frames are progressive, the 3rd and 4th are combed, and so on.

When \f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR is configured to run a matching from bottom

As a result of the field matching, we can see that some frames get duplicated.
To perform a complete inverse telecine, you need to rely on a decimation filter

.Sh "histeq"
.IX Subsection "histeq"
This filter applies a global color histogram equalization on a
per-frame basis.
.PP
It can be used to correct video that has a compressed range of pixel
intensities.  The filter redistributes the pixel intensities to
equalize their distribution across the intensity range. It may be
viewed as an \*(L"automatically adjusting contrast filter\*(R". This filter is
useful only for correcting degraded or poorly captured source
video.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBstrength\fR" 4
.IX Item "strength"
Determine the amount of equalization to be applied.  As the strength
is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more-and-more
approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number
in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.
.IP "\fBintensity\fR" 4
.IX Item "intensity"
Set the maximum intensity that can generated and scale the output
values appropriately.  The strength should be set as desired and then
the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid washing\-out. The value
must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.
.IP "\fBantibanding\fR" 4
.IX Item "antibanding"
Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter will randomly vary
the luminance of output pixels by a small amount to avoid banding of
the histogram. Possible values are \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`weak\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`strong\*(C'\fR. It defaults to \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR.
.Sh "histogram"
.IX Subsection "histogram"
Compute and draw a color distribution histogram for the input video.
.PP
The computed histogram is a representation of the color component
distribution in an image.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBmode\fR" 4
.IX Item "mode"
Set histogram mode.
.Sp
It accepts the following values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBlevels\fR" 4
.IX Item "levels"
Standard histogram that displays the color components distribution in an
image. Displays color graph for each color component. Shows distribution of
the Y, U, V, A or R, G, B components, depending on input format, in the
current frame. Below each graph a color component scale meter is shown.
.IP "\fBcolor\fR" 4
.IX Item "color"
Displays chroma values (U/V color placement) in a two dimensional
graph (which is called a vectorscope). The brighter a pixel in the
vectorscope, the more pixels of the input frame correspond to that pixel
(i.e., more pixels have this chroma value). The V component is displayed on
the horizontal (X) axis, with the leftmost side being V = 0 and the rightmost
side being V = 255. The U component is displayed on the vertical (Y) axis,
with the top representing U = 0 and the bottom representing U = 255.
.Sp
The position of a white pixel in the graph corresponds to the chroma value of
a pixel of the input clip. The graph can therefore be used to read the hue
(color flavor) and the saturation (the dominance of the hue in the color). As
the hue of a color changes, it moves around the square. At the center of the
square the saturation is zero, which means that the corresponding pixel has no
color. If the amount of a specific color is increased (while leaving the other
colors unchanged) the saturation increases, and the indicator moves towards
the edge of the square.
.IP "\fBcolor2\fR" 4
.IX Item "color2"
Chroma values in vectorscope, similar as \f(CW\*(C`color\*(C'\fR but actual chroma values
are displayed.
.IP "\fBwaveform\fR" 4
.IX Item "waveform"
Per row/column color component graph. In row mode, the graph on the left side
represents color component value 0 and the right side represents value = 255.
In column mode, the top side represents color component value = 0 and bottom
side represents value = 255.

.IP "\fBstep\fR" 4
.IX Item "step"
Set step for \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR mode. Smaller values are useful to find out how
many values of the same luminance are distributed across input rows/columns.
Default value is \f(CW10\fR. Allowed range is [1, 255].
.IP "\fBwaveform_mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "waveform_mode"
Set mode for \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR. Can be either \f(CW\*(C`row\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`column\*(C'\fR.
Default is \f(CW\*(C`row\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBwaveform_mirror\fR" 4
.IX Item "waveform_mirror"
Set mirroring mode for \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR. \f(CW0\fR means unmirrored, \f(CW1\fR
means mirrored. In mirrored mode, higher values will be represented on the left
side for \f(CW\*(C`row\*(C'\fR mode and at the top for \f(CW\*(C`column\*(C'\fR mode. Default is
\&\f(CW0\fR (unmirrored).
.IP "\fBdisplay_mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "display_mode"
Set display mode for \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`levels\*(C'\fR.
It accepts the following values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBparade\fR" 4
.IX Item "parade"
Display separate graph for the color components side by side in
\&\f(CW\*(C`row\*(C'\fR waveform mode or one below the other in \f(CW\*(C`column\*(C'\fR waveform mode
for \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR histogram mode. For \f(CW\*(C`levels\*(C'\fR histogram mode,
per color component graphs are placed below each other.
.Sp
Using this display mode in \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR histogram mode makes it easy to
spot color casts in the highlights and shadows of an image, by comparing the
contours of the top and the bottom graphs of each waveform. Since whites,
grays, and blacks are characterized by exactly equal amounts of red, green,
and blue, neutral areas of the picture should display three waveforms of
roughly equal width/height. If not, the correction is easy to perform by
making level adjustments the three waveforms.
.IP "\fBoverlay\fR" 4
.IX Item "overlay"
Presents information identical to that in the \f(CW\*(C`parade\*(C'\fR, except
that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly
over one another.
.Sp
This display mode in \f(CW\*(C`waveform\*(C'\fR histogram mode makes it easier to spot
relative differences or similarities in overlapping areas of the color
components that are supposed to be identical, such as neutral whites, grays,
or blacks.

When this is not 0 then idet will use the specified number of frames to determine
if the interlaced flag is accurate, it will not count undetermined frames.
If the flag is found to be accurate it will be used without any further
computations, if it is found to be inaccuarte it will be cleared without any
further computations. This allows inserting the idet filter as a low computational
method to clean up the interlaced flag
.Sh "il"
.IX Subsection "il"
Deinterleave or interleave fields.
.PP
This filter allows one to process interlaced images fields without
deinterlacing them. Deinterleaving splits the input frame into 2
fields (so called half pictures). Odd lines are moved to the top
half of the output image, even lines to the bottom half.
You can process (filter) them independently and then re-interleave them.

.Sh "lenscorrection"
.IX Subsection "lenscorrection"
Correct radial lens distortion
.PP
This filter can be used to correct for radial distortion as can result from the use
of wide angle lenses, and thereby re-rectify the image. To find the right parameters
one can use tools available for example as part of opencv or simply trial\-and\-error.
To use opencv use the calibration sample (under samples/cpp) from the opencv sources
and extract the k1 and k2 coefficients from the resulting matrix.
.PP
Note that effectively the same filter is available in the open-source tools Krita and
Digikam from the \s-1KDE\s0 project.
.PP
In contrast to the \fBvignette\fR filter, which can also be used to compensate lens errors,
this filter corrects the distortion of the image, whereas \fBvignette\fR corrects the
brightness distribution, so you may want to use both filters together in certain
cases, though you will have to take care of ordering, i.e. whether vignetting should
be applied before or after lens correction.

.PP
To enable this filter, install the libopencv library and headers and
configure FFmpeg with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-libopencv\*(C'\fR.
.PP
It accepts the following parameters:
.IP "\fBfilter_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "filter_name"
The name of the libopencv filter to apply.
.IP "\fBfilter_params\fR" 4
.IX Item "filter_params"
The parameters to pass to the libopencv filter. If not specified, the default
values are assumed.
.PP
Refer to the official libopencv documentation for more precise
information:
<\fBhttp://docs.opencv.org/master/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html\fR>
.PP
Several libopencv filters are supported; see the following subsections.
.PP
\fIdilate\fR
.IX Subsection "dilate"
.PP
Dilate an image by using a specific structuring element.
It corresponds to the libopencv function \f(CW\*(C`cvDilate\*(C'\fR.
.PP
It accepts the parameters: \fIstruct_el\fR|\fInb_iterations\fR.
.PP
\&\fIstruct_el\fR represents a structuring element, and has the syntax:
\&\fIcols\fRx\fIrows\fR+\fIanchor_x\fRx\fIanchor_y\fR/\fIshape\fR
.PP
\&\fIcols\fR and \fIrows\fR represent the number of columns and rows of
the structuring element, \fIanchor_x\fR and \fIanchor_y\fR the anchor
point, and \fIshape\fR the shape for the structuring element. \fIshape\fR
must be \*(L"rect\*(R", \*(L"cross\*(R", \*(L"ellipse\*(R", or \*(L"custom\*(R".
.PP
If the value for \fIshape\fR is \*(L"custom\*(R", it must be followed by a
string of the form "=\fIfilename\fR". The file with name
\&\fIfilename\fR is assumed to represent a binary image, with each
printable character corresponding to a bright pixel. When a custom
\&\fIshape\fR is used, \fIcols\fR and \fIrows\fR are ignored, the number
or columns and rows of the read file are assumed instead.
.PP
The default value for \fIstruct_el\fR is \*(L"3x3+0x0/rect\*(R".
.PP
\&\fInb_iterations\fR specifies the number of times the transform is
applied to the image, and defaults to 1.
.PP

.Ve
.PP
\fIerode\fR
.IX Subsection "erode"
.PP
Erode an image by using a specific structuring element.
It corresponds to the libopencv function \f(CW\*(C`cvErode\*(C'\fR.
.PP
It accepts the parameters: \fIstruct_el\fR:\fInb_iterations\fR,
with the same syntax and semantics as the \fBdilate\fR filter.
.PP
\fIsmooth\fR
.IX Subsection "smooth"
.PP
Smooth the input video.
.PP
The filter takes the following parameters:
\&\fItype\fR|\fIparam1\fR|\fIparam2\fR|\fIparam3\fR|\fIparam4\fR.
.PP
\&\fItype\fR is the type of smooth filter to apply, and must be one of
the following values: \*(L"blur\*(R", \*(L"blur_no_scale\*(R", \*(L"median\*(R", \*(L"gaussian\*(R",
or \*(L"bilateral\*(R". The default value is \*(L"gaussian\*(R".
.PP
The meaning of \fIparam1\fR, \fIparam2\fR, \fIparam3\fR, and \fIparam4\fR
depend on the smooth type. \fIparam1\fR and
\&\fIparam2\fR accept integer positive values or 0. \fIparam3\fR and
\&\fIparam4\fR accept floating point values.
.PP
The default value for \fIparam1\fR is 3. The default value for the
other parameters is 0.
.PP
These parameters correspond to the parameters assigned to the
libopencv function \f(CW\*(C`cvSmooth\*(C'\fR.
.Sh "overlay"

.RE
.IP "\fBrgb\fR \fI(deprecated)\fR" 4
.IX Item "rgb (deprecated)"
If set to 1, force the filter to accept inputs in the \s-1RGB\s0
color space. Default value is 0. This option is deprecated, use
\&\fBformat\fR instead.
.IP "\fBrepeatlast\fR" 4
.IX Item "repeatlast"
If set to 1, force the filter to draw the last overlay frame over the
main input until the end of the stream. A value of 0 disables this
behavior. Default value is 1.
.PP
The \fBx\fR, and \fBy\fR expressions can contain the following
parameters.
.IP "\fBmain_w, W\fR" 4
.IX Item "main_w, W"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBmain_h, H\fR" 4

.IP "\fBt\fR" 4
.IX Item "t"
The timestamp, expressed in seconds. It's \s-1NAN\s0 if the input timestamp is unknown.
.PP
Note that the \fIn\fR, \fIpos\fR, \fIt\fR variables are available only
when evaluation is done \fIper frame\fR, and will evaluate to \s-1NAN\s0
when \fBeval\fR is set to \fBinit\fR.
.PP
Be aware that frames are taken from each input video in timestamp
order, hence, if their initial timestamps differ, it is a good idea
to pass the two inputs through a \fIsetpts=PTS\-STARTPTS\fR filter to
have them begin in the same zero timestamp, as the example for
the \fImovie\fR filter does.
.PP
You can chain together more overlays but you should test the
efficiency of such approach.
.PP

.IP "\fBx\fR" 4
.IX Item "x"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBy\fR" 4

.PP
This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is
considered the \*(L"main\*(R" source and is passed unchanged to the
output. The second input is used as a \*(L"reference\*(R" video for computing
the \s-1PSNR\s0.
.PP
Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.
.PP
The obtained average \s-1PSNR\s0 is printed through the logging system.
.PP
The filter stores the accumulated \s-1MSE\s0 (mean squared error) of each
frame, and at the end of the processing it is averaged across all frames
equally, and the following formula is applied to obtain the \s-1PSNR:\s0
.PP

.IX Subsection "pullup"
Pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of handling mixed
hard\-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive
content.
.PP
The pullup filter is designed to take advantage of future context in making
its decisions. This filter is stateless in the sense that it does not lock
onto a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following
fields in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.
.PP
To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps filter after
pullup, use \f(CW\*(C`fps=24000/1001\*(C'\fR if the input frame rate is 29.97fps,
\&\f(CW\*(C`fps=24\*(C'\fR for 30fps and the (rare) telecined 25fps input.

These options set the amount of \*(L"junk\*(R" to ignore at the left, right, top, and
bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels,
while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines.
The default is 8 pixels on each side.
.IP "\fBsb\fR" 4
.IX Item "sb"
Set the strict breaks. Setting this option to 1 will reduce the chances of
filter generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also cause an
excessive number of frames to be dropped during high motion sequences.
Conversely, setting it to \-1 will make filter match fields more easily.
This may help processing of video where there is slight blurring between
the fields, but may also cause there to be interlaced frames in the output.
Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBmp\fR" 4

.RE
.RS 4

This option may be set to use chroma plane instead of the default luma plane
for doing filter's computations. This may improve accuracy on very clean
source material, but more likely will decrease accuracy, especially if there
is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any grayscale video.
The main purpose of setting \fBmp\fR to a chroma plane is to reduce \s-1CPU\s0
load and make pullup usable in realtime on slow machines.
.RE

.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBfilename, f\fR" 4
.IX Item "filename, f"
Set the filter bitmap file, which can be any image format supported by
libavformat. The width and height of the image file must match those of the
video stream being processed.
.PP
Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not
considered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of
the logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the
rest, you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is
recommended to take a screen capture of a black frame with the logo
visible, and then using a threshold filter followed by the erode
filter once or twice.
.PP
If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if
logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much
reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as
much, but it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over
the image and will destroy more information than necessary, and extra
pixels will slow things down on a large logo.

One useful instance of this option is that when you know a specific device's
maximum allowed resolution, you can use this to limit the output video to
that, while retaining the aspect ratio. For example, device A allows
1280x720 playback, and your video is 1920x800. Using this option (set it to
decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the output
1280x533.

Apply a simple postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses the image
at several (or \- in the case of \fBquality\fR level \f(CW6\fR \- all) shifts
and average the results.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBquality\fR" 4
.IX Item "quality"
Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts
an integer in the range 0\-6. If set to \f(CW0\fR, the filter will have no
effect. A value of \f(CW6\fR means the higher quality. For each increment of
that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2.  Default value is
\&\f(CW3\fR.
.IP "\fBqp\fR" 4

Enable the use of the \s-1QP\s0 from the B\-Frames if set to \f(CW1\fR. Using this
option may cause flicker since the B\-Frames have often larger \s-1QP\s0. Default is
\&\f(CW0\fR (not enabled).
.Sh "subtitles"
.IX Subsection "subtitles"
Draw subtitles on top of input video using the libass library.
.PP
To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-libass\*(C'\fR. This filter also requires a build with libavcodec and
libavformat to convert the passed subtitles file to \s-1ASS\s0 (Advanced Substation
Alpha) subtitles format.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBfilename, f\fR" 4
.IX Item "filename, f"
Set the filename of the subtitle file to read. It must be specified.
.IP "\fBoriginal_size\fR" 4
.IX Item "original_size"
Specify the size of the original video, the video for which the \s-1ASS\s0 file
was composed. For the syntax of this option, check the \*(L"Video size\*(R" section in
the ffmpeg-utils manual. Due to a misdesign in \s-1ASS\s0 aspect ratio arithmetic,
this is necessary to correctly scale the fonts if the aspect ratio has been
changed.
.IP "\fBcharenc\fR" 4
.IX Item "charenc"
Set subtitles input character encoding. \f(CW\*(C`subtitles\*(C'\fR filter only. Only
useful if not \s-1UTF\-8\s0.
.IP "\fBstream_index, si\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream_index, si"
Set subtitles stream index. \f(CW\*(C`subtitles\*(C'\fR filter only.
.PP
If the first key is not specified, it is assumed that the first value
specifies the \fBfilename\fR.
.PP
For example, to render the file \fIsub.srt\fR on top of the input
video, use the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        subtitles=sub.srt
.Ve
.PP
which is equivalent to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        subtitles=filename=sub.srt

To render the default subtitles stream from file \fIvideo.mkv\fR, use:
.PP
.Vb 1

Specify the time of the first frame that will be dropped, i.e. the frame
immediately preceding the one with the timestamp \fIend\fR will be the last
frame in the output.
.IP "\fBstart_pts\fR" 4

in timebase units instead of seconds.

in timebase units instead of seconds.
.IP "\fBduration\fR" 4
.IX Item "duration"

.IP "\fBend_frame\fR" 4
.IX Item "end_frame"

\&\fBstart\fR, \fBend\fR, and \fBduration\fR are expressed as time
duration specifications; see
\&\fBthe Time duration section in the \f(BIffmpeg\-utils\fB\|(1) manual\fR
for the accepted syntax.
.PP
Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the \fBduration\fR
option look at the frame timestamp, while the _frame variants simply count the
frames that pass through the filter. Also note that this filter does not modify
the timestamps. If you wish for the output timestamps to start at zero, insert a
setpts filter after the trim filter.
.PP
If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all the frames that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple trim
filters.
.PP
The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.

This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in \fIlibavfilter/vsrc_buffer.h\fR.
.PP
It accepts the following parameters:
.IP "\fBvideo_size\fR" 4
.IX Item "video_size"
Specify the size (width and height) of the buffered video frames. For the
syntax of this option, check the \*(L"Video size\*(R" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual.
.IP "\fBwidth\fR" 4
.IX Item "width"
The input video width.
.IP "\fBheight\fR" 4
.IX Item "height"
The input video height.
.IP "\fBpix_fmt\fR" 4
.IX Item "pix_fmt"
A string representing the pixel format of the buffered video frames.
It may be a number corresponding to a pixel format, or a pixel format
name.

For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        buffer=width=320:height=240:pix_fmt=yuv410p:time_base=1/24:sar=1
.Ve
.PP
will instruct the source to accept video frames with size 320x240 and
with format \*(L"yuv410p\*(R", assuming 1/24 as the timestamps timebase and
square pixels (1:1 sample aspect ratio).
Since the pixel format with name \*(L"yuv410p\*(R" corresponds to the number 6
(check the enum AVPixelFormat definition in \fIlibavutil/pixfmt.h\fR),
this example corresponds to:
.PP
.Vb 1

.IX Item "random_fill_ratio, ratio"
Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a
floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.
It is ignored when a file is specified.
.IP "\fBrandom_seed, seed\fR" 4
.IX Item "random_seed, seed"
Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be an integer
included between 0 and \s-1UINT32_MAX\s0. If not specified, or if explicitly
set to \-1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
effort basis.
.IP "\fBrule\fR" 4
.IX Item "rule"
Set the life rule.
.Sp
A rule can be specified with a code of the kind "S\fI\s-1NS\s0\fR/B\fI\s-1NB\s0\fR",
where \fI\s-1NS\s0\fR and \fI\s-1NB\s0\fR are sequences of numbers in the range 0\-8,
\&\fI\s-1NS\s0\fR specifies the number of alive neighbor cells which make a
live cell stay alive, and \fI\s-1NB\s0\fR the number of alive neighbor cells
which make a dead cell to become alive (i.e. to \*(L"born\*(R").
\&\*(L"s\*(R" and \*(L"b\*(R" can be used in place of \*(L"S\*(R" and \*(L"B\*(R", respectively.
.Sp
Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18\-bits integer. The 9
high order bits are used to encode the next cell state if it is alive
for each number of neighbor alive cells, the low order bits specify
the rule for \*(L"borning\*(R" new cells. Higher order bits encode for an
higher number of neighbor cells.
For example the number 6153 = \f(CW\*(C`(12<<9)+9\*(C'\fR specifies a stay alive
rule of 12 and a born rule of 9, which corresponds to \*(L"S23/B03\*(R".
.Sp
Default value is \*(L"S23/B3\*(R", which is the original Conway's game of life
rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor alive
cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive cells around
a dead cell.
.IP "\fBsize, s\fR" 4
.IX Item "size, s"
Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the
\&\*(L"Video size\*(R" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.
.Sp
If \fBfilename\fR is specified, the size is set by default to the
same size of the input file. If \fBsize\fR is set, it must contain
the size specified in the input file, and the initial grid defined in
that file is centered in the larger resulting area.
.Sp
If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults to \*(L"320x240\*(R"
(used for a randomly generated initial grid).
.IP "\fBstitch\fR" 4
.IX Item "stitch"
If set to 1, stitch the left and right grid edges together, and the
top and bottom edges also. Defaults to 1.
.IP "\fBmold\fR" 4

.Sh "avectorscope"
.IX Subsection "avectorscope"
Convert input audio to a video output, representing the audio vector
scope.
.PP
The filter is used to measure the difference between channels of stereo
audio stream. A monoaural signal, consisting of identical left and right
signal, results in straight vertical line. Any stereo separation is visible
as a deviation from this line, creating a Lissajous figure.
If the straight (or deviation from it) but horizontal line appears this
indicates that the left and right channels are out of phase.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBmode, m\fR" 4

.Sh "concat"
.IX Subsection "concat"
Concatenate audio and video streams, joining them together one after the
other.
.PP
The filter works on segments of synchronized video and audio streams. All
segments must have the same number of streams of each type, and that will
also be the number of streams at output.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
Set the number of segments. Default is 2.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"
Set the number of output video streams, that is also the number of video
streams in each segment. Default is 1.
.IP "\fBa\fR" 4
.IX Item "a"
Set the number of output audio streams, that is also the number of audio
streams in each segment. Default is 0.
.IP "\fBunsafe\fR" 4
.IX Item "unsafe"
Activate unsafe mode: do not fail if segments have a different format.
.PP
The filter has \fIv\fR+\fIa\fR outputs: first \fIv\fR video outputs, then
\&\fIa\fR audio outputs.
.PP
There are \fIn\fRx(\fIv\fR+\fIa\fR) inputs: first the inputs for the first
segment, in the same order as the outputs, then the inputs for the second
segment, etc.
.PP
Related streams do not always have exactly the same duration, for various
reasons including codec frame size or sloppy authoring. For that reason,
related synchronized streams (e.g. a video and its audio track) should be
concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the duration of the longest
stream in each segment (except the last one), and if necessary pad shorter
audio streams with silence.
.PP
For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start at timestamp 0.
.PP
All corresponding streams must have the same parameters in all segments; the
filtering system will automatically select a common pixel format for video
streams, and a common sample format, sample rate and channel layout for
audio streams, but other settings, such as resolution, must be converted
explicitly by the user.
.PP
Different frame rates are acceptable but will result in variable frame rate
at output; be sure to configure the output file to handle it.

Temporally interleave frames from several inputs.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`interleave\*(C'\fR works with video inputs, \f(CW\*(C`ainterleave\*(C'\fR with audio.
.PP
These filters read frames from several inputs and send the oldest
queued frame to the output.
.PP
Input streams must have a well defined, monotonically increasing frame
timestamp values.
.PP
In order to submit one frame to output, these filters need to enqueue
at least one frame for each input, so they cannot work in case one
input is not yet terminated and will not receive incoming frames.
.PP
For example consider the case when one input is a \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR filter
which always drop input frames. The \f(CW\*(C`interleave\*(C'\fR filter will keep
reading from that input, but it will never be able to send new frames
to output until the input will send an end-of-stream signal.

Also, depending on inputs synchronization, the filters will drop
frames in case one input receives more frames than the other ones, and
the queue is already filled.

\fICommands syntax\fR
.IX Subsection "Commands syntax"
.PP
A commands description consists of a sequence of interval
specifications, comprising a list of commands to be executed when a
particular event related to that interval occurs. The occurring event
is typically the current frame time entering or leaving a given time
interval.
.PP
An interval is specified by the following syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        <START>[-<END>] <COMMANDS>;
.Ve
.PP
The time interval is specified by the \fI\s-1START\s0\fR and \fI\s-1END\s0\fR times.
\&\fI\s-1END\s0\fR is optional and defaults to the maximum time.
.PP
The current frame time is considered within the specified interval if
it is included in the interval [\fI\s-1START\s0\fR, \fI\s-1END\s0\fR), that is when
the time is greater or equal to \fI\s-1START\s0\fR and is lesser than
\&\fI\s-1END\s0\fR.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1COMMANDS\s0\fR consists of a sequence of one or more command
specifications, separated by \*(L",\*(R", relating to that interval.  The
syntax of a command specification is given by:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        [<FLAGS>] <TARGET> <COMMAND> <ARG>
.Ve
.PP
\&\fI\s-1FLAGS\s0\fR is optional and specifies the type of events relating to
the time interval which enable sending the specified command, and must
be a non-null sequence of identifier flags separated by \*(L"+\*(R" or \*(L"|\*(R" and
enclosed between \*(L"[\*(R" and \*(L"]\*(R".
.PP
The following flags are recognized:
.IP "\fBenter\fR" 4
.IX Item "enter"
The command is sent when the current frame timestamp enters the
specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
previous frame timestamp was not in the given interval, and the
current is.
.IP "\fBleave\fR" 4
.IX Item "leave"
The command is sent when the current frame timestamp leaves the
specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
previous frame timestamp was in the given interval, and the
current is not.
.PP
If \fI\s-1FLAGS\s0\fR is not specified, a default value of \f(CW\*(C`[enter]\*(C'\fR is
assumed.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1TARGET\s0\fR specifies the target of the command, usually the name of
the filter class or a specific filter instance name.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1COMMAND\s0\fR specifies the name of the command for the target filter.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1ARG\s0\fR is optional and specifies the optional list of argument for
the given \fI\s-1COMMAND\s0\fR.
.PP
Between one interval specification and another, whitespaces, or
sequences of characters starting with \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR until the end of line,
are ignored and can be used to annotate comments.
.PP
A simplified \s-1BNF\s0 description of the commands specification syntax
follows:

Receive commands sent through a libzmq client, and forward them to
filters in the filtergraph.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`zmq\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`azmq\*(C'\fR work as a pass-through filters. \f(CW\*(C`zmq\*(C'\fR
must be inserted between two video filters, \f(CW\*(C`azmq\*(C'\fR between two
audio filters.
.PP
To enable these filters you need to install the libzmq library and
headers and configure FFmpeg with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-libzmq\*(C'\fR.
.PP
For more information about libzmq see:
<\fBhttp://www.zeromq.org/\fR>
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`zmq\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`azmq\*(C'\fR filters work as a libzmq server, which
receives messages sent through a network interface defined by the
\&\fBbind_address\fR option.
.PP
The received message must be in the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        <TARGET> <COMMAND> [<ARG>]
.Ve
.PP
\&\fI\s-1TARGET\s0\fR specifies the target of the command, usually the name of
the filter class or a specific filter instance name.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1COMMAND\s0\fR specifies the name of the command for the target filter.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1ARG\s0\fR is optional and specifies the optional argument list for the
given \fI\s-1COMMAND\s0\fR.
.PP
Upon reception, the message is processed and the corresponding command
is injected into the filtergraph. Depending on the result, the filter
will send a reply to the client, adopting the format:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        <ERROR_CODE> <ERROR_REASON>

.SH "MULTIMEDIA SOURCES"
.IX Header "MULTIMEDIA SOURCES"
Below is a description of the currently available multimedia sources.
.Sh "amovie"
.IX Subsection "amovie"
This is the same as \fBmovie\fR source, except it selects an audio
stream by default.
.Sh "movie"
.IX Subsection "movie"
Read audio and/or video stream(s) from a movie container.
.PP
It accepts the following parameters:
.IP "\fBfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "filename"
The name of the resource to read (not necessarily a file; it can also be a
device or a stream accessed through some protocol).
.IP "\fBformat_name, f\fR" 4
.IX Item "format_name, f"
Specifies the format assumed for the movie to read, and can be either
the name of a container or an input device. If not specified, the
format is guessed from \fImovie_name\fR or by probing.
.IP "\fBseek_point, sp\fR" 4
.IX Item "seek_point, sp"
Specifies the seek point in seconds. The frames will be output
starting from this seek point. The parameter is evaluated with
\&\f(CW\*(C`av_strtod\*(C'\fR, so the numerical value may be suffixed by an \s-1IS\s0
postfix. The default value is \*(L"0\*(R".
.IP "\fBstreams, s\fR" 4
.IX Item "streams, s"
Specifies the streams to read. Several streams can be specified,
separated by \*(L"+\*(R". The source will then have as many outputs, in the
same order. The syntax is explained in the ``Stream specifiers''
section in the ffmpeg manual. Two special names, \*(L"dv\*(R" and \*(L"da\*(R" specify
respectively the default (best suited) video and audio stream. Default
is \*(L"dv\*(R", or \*(L"da\*(R" if the filter is called as \*(L"amovie\*(R".
.IP "\fBstream_index, si\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream_index, si"
Specifies the index of the video stream to read. If the value is \-1,
the most suitable video stream will be automatically selected. The default
value is \*(L"\-1\*(R". Deprecated. If the filter is called \*(L"amovie\*(R", it will select
audio instead of video.
.IP "\fBloop\fR" 4
.IX Item "loop"
Specifies how many times to read the stream in sequence.
If the value is less than 1, the stream will be read again and again.
Default value is \*(L"1\*(R".
.Sp
Note that when the movie is looped the source timestamps are not
changed, so it will generate non monotonically increasing timestamps.
.PP
It allows overlaying a second video on top of the main input of
a filtergraph, as shown in this graph:
.PP
