## <a name="developer"> for Developers

requirement: install Qt development environment and Git

Before starting this task, create a new branch e.g. `localize-(locale)`  
NOTE: `(locale)` is a place-holder, replace to your actual locale.

### 1. Add new translation

This is an initial task, need only once per 1 translation.

1. add `TRANSLATIONS + $PWD/(locale).ts` to `translations/translations.pri`
2. add `<file alias="messages.qm" lang="(locale)">../../translations/(locale).qm</file>` to `./src/resources/jamtaba.qrc`

### 2. Update translation

invoke `lupdate ./PROJECTS/Jamtaba.pro` command to update/generate .ts file

### 3. Translate

open the updated/generated `./translations/(locale).ts` file by Qt Linguist

### 4. Release

.ts file is a source code for message translation.  
need to compile them into .qm binary file which Qt application can load.


#### 4.1 Qt Linguist

run "Release" operation in Qt Linguist, will generate .qm file  
NOTE: this will generate only current opened file.

#### 4.2 or command line tool

invoke `lrelease PROJECTS/Jamtaba.pro`  
NOTE: this command will generate all translation files listed in `TRANSLATIONS`


### 5. Make PR(Pull Request)

As general GitHub workflow, create PR.

## <a name="non-developer"> for Non-Developer contributors

non-developer contributors here
assume they are not install Qt development environment.

1. ask developers to generate/update `./translations/(locale).ts` file
2. edit `./translations/(locale).ts` by text editor (which support utf-8 encoding)
3. ask developers to do release tasks.

### How to make Pull Request

We need the (locale).ts file which you had modified.
How you can send the file, we use GitHub Pull Request as the workflow.

   e.g: `translate-v2.14.0-ja_JP` NOTE the version is development version
   https://github.com/blog/1377-create-and-delete-branches
2. upload (locale).ts file into `./translations` directory.

## Q&A

- why use GitHub? can't just send the .ts file via E-mail?
  - GitHub system will automatically record who's contributed.
- What is "Locale" ?
  - It's a pair of language code and country code
- how to find the locale string
  - see details: http://userguide.icu-project.org/locale
